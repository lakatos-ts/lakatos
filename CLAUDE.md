# CLAUDE.md

Monorepo for lakatos: proofs and refutations for TypeScript. `README.md` (Layout, Architecture) is the tour; each engine's own `CLAUDE.md` loads when you work under it.

Start from `src/cli.ts` (the `prove|refute|check` spine; `check` is still a NotTried stub) and `core/src/envelope.ts` + `core/src/szs.ts` (the per-annotation output contract, schema in `core/schemas/`).

## Layering

`engines/thales/` (proofs, Lean) and `engines/pabst/` (refutations, fast-check) never depend on each other. Both may depend on `core/` (`@lakatos-ts/core`: the shared runtime — envelope, SZS statuses, interrupt handling, run directories; depends on nothing in the repo), `lemma/` (the Lemma annotation language: discovery, `@ensures` extraction, parsing; spec and conformance corpus in `spec/`) and `tarski/` (the shared JS-semantics Lean package thales proves against; see its `CLAUDE.md`), which depend on no engine. `src/` may depend on all of them. The root is a private npm workspace root; `core/` is its first workspace package, and `engines/thales/package.json` is private dev tooling for its check scripts, not a package.

## Building and testing

Every TypeScript part — `src/`, `core/`, `lemma/`, pabst, thales's `frontend/` — builds, typechecks, tests, and formats from the repo root (`tsc -b` builds `core/` first; vitest runs core from source through an alias, the built CLI resolves it through the workspace link). Lean lives in two lake packages: `tarski/` (the semantics library, toolchain pin, tracked manifest) and `engines/thales/` (the prover, which requires `tarski` by path). Run `lake` from the package you are building; building thales builds tarski. `lakatos prove` needs a lakatos checkout with the Lean toolchain; the prove e2e and verdict corpus run only under `LAKATOS_PROVE_E2E=1` (CI: `thales.yml`; `tarski.yml` builds the semantics package and runs its Lean tests; `lakatos.yml` covers the TypeScript suites, typecheck, format, and a coverage gate).

## Issue tracker

GitHub Issues on `lakatos-ts/lakatos` is the tracker: bugs, features, triage, and everything a PR or design record refers to by number. Conventions: `engines/thales/docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`; triage labels: `engines/thales/docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.

Beads (`bd`, below) is agent-local task tracking within a session, not a second issue tracker: a bead is a step toward an issue, never a substitute for filing one.

## Docs

Design records spanning more than one component go in `docs/design/`; a single engine's notes stay under that engine (`engines/thales/docs/`). Records are dated and are not updated to track the code.

## Beads (agent task tracking)

`bd` tracks an agent's in-session tasks and handoffs. Run `bd prime` for the command reference.

```bash
bd ready              # Find available work
bd show <id>          # View issue details
bd update <id> --claim  # Claim work
bd close <id>         # Complete work
```

- Use `bd` instead of TodoWrite, TaskCreate, or markdown TODO lists for task tracking; anything that outlives the session goes to GitHub Issues.
- Persistent memory stays in Claude Code's own memory files; do not use `bd remember` for it.
- Every task bead is poured from the `reviewed-task` formula (`bd mol pour reviewed-task --var "title=..."`, or `bd mol bond <epic> reviewed-task --var ...` under an epic), so a separate review bead blocks on the work and nothing counts as done until the review closes. The reviewer closes the molecule root after its own bead; epics are reviewed and closed by hand.
- `planned-task` is `reviewed-task` with a plan step in front (plan → implement → review): the plan step writes the implementation plan into the implement bead's design field. It is the formula for GitHub epic #376's children.
- Worker loops: `scripts/bd-worker.fish plan|review|implement` claims the next ready bead with that label under the session epic and runs `claude -p` on `scripts/prompts/<label>.md`; run one review loop, one implement loop, and as many plan loops as the fan-out needs; `scripts/bd-pour-next.fish` pours a `planned-task` molecule for each GitHub child that has become unblocked. A red gate on an implement bead files one `repair` bead; a second failure adds a human gate. Only the script creates repair beads.
- Issues live in a local Dolt DB; sync uses `refs/dolt/data` on the git remote; `.beads/issues.jsonl` is a passive export. Never commit, push, or sync Dolt unless asked.
- At session end: close finished beads, file GitHub issues for follow-up work, run the local gate if code changed, and report changed files and status before any commit or push.
