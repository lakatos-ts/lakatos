 * A pass also maps to GaveUp when the domain was sampled: N clean runs
 * refute nothing, and the engine stopped of its own accord — the `kind`
 * field disambiguates. A pass over a domain the refuter walked in full is
 * a Theorem, `kind` enumerated. Theorem and
 * Inappropriate come from the prove pipeline: a property proven for all
 * inputs, and an annotation depending on code outside the mappable subset
 * (its `reason` names the offending construct). CounterSatisfiable comes
 * from either engine — a sampled counterexample from refute, or a witness
 * searched out of a bounded domain that decide established false — in the
 * same falsified shape either way. InputError marks an
 * annotation whose input is malformed at extraction (a duplicate property
 * name, an inaccessible subject) or whose program fails to type check;
 * its `error` carries the diagnostic and the run exits 2, the documented
 * error mode. Timeout marks an annotation whose proof attempt exceeded
 * its per-annotation budget, or whose enumeration ran out of wall clock
 * before walking its domain; later annotations in the same file still
 * run. User marks an annotation an interrupted run never finished
 * evaluating: processing stopped at the user's request.
