/-! The `tarski` binary: `tarski run <file.json>` and
`tarski exec <file.json>`.

One ESTree document in — the JSON `schemas/tarski-estree.schema.json`
fixes, as the parser bridge produces it — one line out: the script's
completion value, or nothing when no statement produced one.

`exec` is what `thales-exe` calls, and its one difference from `run` is
that it prints **no** completion value: a program run for its effects
answers nothing a user asked for, and `node file.js` prints none either.
Everything else — the print log, the uncaught report, the exit codes — is
`run`'s exactly.

Exit codes:

* `0` — the script ran. Under `run`, its completion value, if any, is
  on stdout; under `exec` there is no such line.
* `1` — the script ended with an uncaught abrupt completion. `Uncaught `
  and the thrown value are on stderr: `<name>: <message>` for an Error
  object, the value's printed form otherwise.
* `2` — the input is not a script this binary can be handed: bad usage,
  an unreadable file, text that is not JSON, or a document outside the
  schema. The reason is on stderr.
* `3` — the script contains a node the evaluator does not know.
  `unsupported:` and the node kind are on stderr.

What the host's `print` was given is on stdout, one line per call, ahead
of the completion value and ahead of any report on stderr. The lines are
accumulated in the heap during the run (see `%PrintLog%` in
`Tarski/Realm.lean`) and written out once, so a run that ends abruptly
still shows what it printed before it did.

Divergence is not an exit code. A program that does not terminate is a
run this binary never returns from; the caller imposes a timeout and
reads the answer from that. -/
