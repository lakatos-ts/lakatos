/-! The evaluator: a definitional interpreter over `EvalM`.

Every primitive operation delegates to the `Js` library — the same
definitions `thales` proves against — and the evaluator adds only
dispatch. Nothing here is `partial` in Lean's sense: the recursion is
defined by `partial_fixpoint`, so the equations are theorems and a
non-terminating program is `none`, not an axiom.

The non-recursive helpers live outside the `mutual` block on purpose:
their equations are ordinary and `simp` may use them freely. The rule for
the recursive ones is not "recursive" but "recursive on something other
than syntax" — `evalExpr` and its neighbours recurse on a concrete AST,
which runs out, while a loop recurses until a heap value says stop, a
prototype walk until a heap link does, and a join until an array's length
does, and `simp` unfolds all three under a binder it has not resolved,
forever. So the loop arms — `evalWhile`, `evalDoWhile`, `evalFor`, and
`evalForOf` — and the list walks — `joinElements`, `listFromArrayLike`,
`forInNext`, the step from one object of a `for`-`in` to its prototype,
and the four walks that run until an iterator says stop (`iteratorToList`,
`fromEntriesInto`, `groupByInto`) — never join a simp set at all and are
unfolded one step at a time with `rw`, as are the three steps a bound
function's target is reached by — `callBound`, `constructBound`, and
`instanceOfBound`. `getFromUp`, `findPropertyUp`,
`protoChainHas`, and `construct` join `tarski_eval` only as *guarded
simprocs* (`Tarski/Simp.lean`), which fire when the reference they are
handed is a literal — which is what a concrete heap has already
resolved, and what the manual `rw` used to wait for. `getProp` and
`getFrom` are plain members: the first is the dispatch onto the second,
and the second answers an own property without recursing — the two
prototype *steps* are what recurse, and they are the two guarded
definitions above. What decides membership in the block is
whether a definition can reach user code: `getProp`, `toPrimitive`, and
`setProp` can (a getter or a setter is user code, ToPrimitive calls
`valueOf`, and ArraySetLength coerces its value with ToNumber, which is
ToPrimitive on an object), so they are inside; `instantiateBlock` and
`makeFunction` only touch the heap, so they are outside.

## The property protocol

Every own property carries the four attributes 6.1.7.1 gives it, and
`Tarski/Value.lean`'s `Obj.applyDescriptor` is 10.1.6.3 as a pure
function, so the table that decides whether a redefinition is legal is
`#guard`-testable without a heap. What is here is the part that throws.

OrdinaryGet is unchanged in shape. **OrdinarySet finds the first own
property on the chain** — `findProperty`, which replaced the old
accessor-only search — and refuses a non-writable data property or an
accessor with no setter; an own write that would *add* a key to a
non-extensible object refuses too. `[[Delete]]` refuses a
non-configurable key. Every one of those refusals is a strict-mode
`TypeError`, this epic having no sloppy mode to be silent in.

NamedEvaluation is one definition, `evalNamed`, called from the four
places the specification gives an anonymous function a name: a
declarator, an assignment to an identifier, an object literal's member,
and a class field. An anonymous function that reaches `evalExpr` any
other way is named `""`, which is what the specification gives it too.

## The iteration protocol

GetIterator, IteratorStepValue, and IteratorClose (7.4.3, 7.4.8, 7.4.11)
are `getIterator`, `iteratorStep`, and `iteratorClose`, three ordinary
members of the block. An Iterator Record here is a `{ iterator, next }`
pair with `next` read **once**, as the specification reads it, and no
`[[Done]]` field at all: *done* is which code path a throw took. A throw
from `next`, from the result's `done`, or from its `value` escapes an
`attempt`-free call and no `return` is called; a throw from anything
between two steps is caught with `attempt` and closes the iterator. That
is 7.4.8–7.4.11 read as control flow, and it is what keeps `iteratorStep`
a plain member and each walk one `attempt`.

Destructuring is one walk, `bindPattern`, for both pattern families:
ESTree gives them one node family and 14.3.3 and 13.15.5 are the same
order. `BindMode` says how a leaf is *written* — `.init` is
InitializeReferencedBinding on a cell instantiation allocated, `.var` and
`.assign` are PutValue — and `LeafRef` is a leaf's reference evaluated
**before** the value is stepped or read, which 13.15.5.4 and 13.15.5.5
require of an assignment pattern and a binding pattern never needs.

`evalForOf` is ForIn/OfBodyEvaluation for `iterate`: the per-iteration
binding is *inside* the `attempt`, because step 6.h closes the iterator
when the binding itself fails, and every exit but exhaustion and a throw
from the iterator closes — a `break`, a `continue` this loop does not
answer for, a `return`, a body throw. Spread and an array literal's
holes are `evalArgs` and `evalArrayElements`: ArgumentListEvaluation and
ArrayAccumulation, each iterating a `.spread` and counting a `.hole`
without defining anything.

`for`-`in` is EnumerateObjectProperties' informative algorithm, 14.7.5.9:
each object's own string keys are snapshotted when that object is
reached, a key is visited only if it is *still* own and enumerable when
its turn comes, and every key already seen shadows the prototypes'. The
keys of one level are data, so only the step to the next object
(`forInNext`) is `rw`'s: a proof unfolds object levels, not keys. The
head is a `ForInLeft` and `bindForIn` the per-iteration binder for a
`for`-`of` too: the two heads are the same production.

A block's declarations are instantiated before its first statement runs.
That is one mechanism answering three needs: the temporal dead zone (a
cell exists but holds nothing until its declarator runs), a function
declaration callable above its own text, and two declarations that call
each other.

Four bindings in the scope chain are the evaluator's own rather than any
source name's: `thisName`, `homeName`, `newTargetName`, and
`activeFunctionName`. `this` is a keyword and the other three are
spelled with a `%` or a `.`, so no identifier collides with one; putting
them in the chain rather than in a frame is what lets an arrow see all
four lexically, and what makes a derived constructor's "before
`super()`" the ordinary temporal dead zone with a message of its own.

A class declaration is hoisted like a `let` and is in that same dead zone
until its declaration runs. `evalClass` is ClassDefinitionEvaluation,
`constructClass` a class constructor's `[[Construct]]`, and a field is a
*definition* — never a write — evaluated per instance after `super()`
has returned.

FunctionDeclarationInstantiation (10.2.11) is `instantiateFunction`, the
one place a call's scope is built. Parameters are cells in a dead zone of
their own, initialized left to right, so a default may read a parameter
to its left and not one to its right. With an initializer present the
`var`s get a scope of their own whose cells start from the parameters'
values (step 28); without one they share the parameters' cells (step
27). A pattern parameter's names are cells exactly as a plain
parameter's are, and a rest parameter takes every argument left over as a
fresh array. `arguments` is a source name bound to an immutable cell
when — and only when — the function's own code spells it, which
`mentionsArguments` decides once per function object; without `eval` and the `Function`
constructor, both outside this epic, an unspelled `arguments` cannot be
observed. A function's `length` is ExpectedArgumentCount, an own data
property `makeFunction` and `evalClass` define.

A `var` is instantiated somewhere else and at another time. `varNames`
collects VarDeclaredNames over a whole function body or script — through
blocks, loops, `switch` clauses, and `try` parts, but never into a
nested function — and `hoistVars` gives each of them a cell holding
`undefined` before the body runs. That is why a `var` has no dead zone,
why a block's `var` outlives the block, and why a `var` naming a
parameter or an existing global keeps the binding already there rather
than erasing it.

## The `Array` surface

Every member of `Array.prototype` is **generic over an array-like**, as
23.1.3 has each of them: the receiver goes through `toObjectValue` — so a
string receiver meets #391's refusal until the wrapper object exists —
its length through `lengthOfArrayLike`, its elements are read with
`getProp` and their presence asked with `hasProperty`, so that a hole is
a key that is not there; writes go through `setProp` (Set with Throw
true), deletes through `deleteProp` (DeletePropertyOrThrow), and a result
is filled in with `createDataPropertyOrThrow`. `arraySpeciesCreate` is
ArraySpeciesCreate whole, **`@@species` read and all**, and `spreadInto`
carries IsConcatSpreadable whole: both symbols are in the realm as of
#392, and `get Array[@@species]` is the intrinsic that makes a subclass
its own species.

`callArrayNative` is the surface's own dispatcher, outside the simp set
as `callReflectNative` is and for the same reason. The walks it performs
recurse on a length the heap named rather than on syntax, so each is a
`rw`'s and none joins a simp set: `visitElements` — the seven callback
members in one definition over a `VisitKind` — `reduceFrom`,
`reduceRightFrom`, `firstPresent`, `lastPresent`, `indexOfFrom`,
`lastIndexOfFrom`, `includesFrom`, `fillFrom`, `reverseFrom`,
`copyElements`, `moveElements`, `deleteFrom`, `flattenInto`,
`toLocaleStringFrom`, `collectPresent`, `mergeSortValues`,
`mergeValues`, and `fromArrayLike`.

## The messages the evaluator raises

Every runtime error the evaluator itself throws is here, verbatim,
V8-shaped where that was free. test262 never inspects a message; the
table exists so the tests can pin what the binary prints, and so that a
new refusal is written against a list rather than invented.

The last two `SyntaxError`s are unreachable through the decoder, which
never places a spread or a hole outside the lists that iterate them;
they are stated as the placeholder rows they are. The other three stand
in for early errors the epic does not
check: they are raised where the construct is *used* rather than where
the script is parsed. `Object.prototype.toString`'s tags are not
messages and are not here.

order when *both* sides are strings and numeric otherwise, which is
IsLessThan's own split: `"10" < "9"` is true and `"a" < 1` is false,
the latter because ToNumber of `"a"` is NaN and every relation on a NaN
is false.
A string is a sequence of UTF-16 code units, so the four relations are
IsLessThan step 3 exactly — **code-unit** order, under which
`"\u{10000}" < "\uFFFF"` is true, where code-point order says the
opposite.

gets a fresh `prototype` object whose `constructor` points back at it,
which is what `new` links an instance to; that property is writable and
nothing else, and the object is created against `Object.prototype` like
any other. An arrow gets neither, because it cannot be constructed. The
function object's own `[[Prototype]]` is `Function.prototype`.

`""`. -/

`b` before initialization — and what lets a default read a parameter to

/-- Get a property, walking the prototype chain. There is no fuel bound:
a cyclic chain is a program that does not terminate, which is `none`, and
that is the same answer the epic gives every other divergence.

Two own properties do not live in a property list. A string answers its
own `length` and its own index properties — the String exotic object's
`[[GetOwnProperty]]` — and every other key on it is read through
`String.prototype`. An array answers its own `length` out of its kind,
which is where the live length lives.

A Number, a Boolean, a String, or a Symbol base reads through its wrapper
prototype **without allocating a wrapper**: a Number's, a Boolean's, or a
Symbol's wrapper would have no own properties, and a String's own
properties are the ones answered above, so the answer is the same, and
the receiver a method call then gets is still the primitive, which is why
`thisNumberValue`, `thisStringValue`, and `thisSymbolValue` accept both. A
bigint base still answers `undefined`, `BigInt.prototype` being outside
this epic.

This is inside the fixpoint block because a getter is user code called
from here. It is no longer the walk itself, though: `getFrom` is, and
this is the dispatch onto it, so this one may join a simp set while
`getFrom` is unfolded a step at a time like every other heap
recursion. -/

called on that receiver rather than on the object the property was found
on, which is what makes an inherited getter see the instance; a getter-
less accessor reads `undefined`. A Number or a Boolean base starts the
walk at its wrapper prototype with the primitive as the receiver, which
is why `thisNumberValue` accepts one.

The own step is `Obj.ownProperty`, the one `[[GetOwnProperty]]`, so an
array's `length` and a String object's indices are answered here by the
same definition `findProperty` and `deleteProp` read.

/-- Run a built-in.

`.errorCtor` is the shared body of the seven `Error` constructors: it
sets `message` on the object it was handed, when an argument other than
`undefined` was given, and answers that object. It never allocates, so
`new E(m)` and `E(m)` differ only in who allocates — which is what lets
`construct` hand it a fresh object and `callFunction` route to
`construct`. The `options` argument, and so `cause`, is ignored; there is
no `stack`.

`.errorToString` is `Error.prototype.toString`: `name` and `message` off
the receiver, each defaulting when absent, joined by `": "` unless one of
them is empty. The uncaught-error report runs this same algorithm, which
is the reason it is exposed at all.

The rest are #380's floor. `String(v)` is ToString and nothing else;
`new String(v)` is `constructNative`'s, and the two differ only there, as
`Number`'s two spellings do. `Object(v)` is an ordinary object for a
nullish argument and ToObject otherwise — the argument itself for an
object, and the wrapper for a Number, a Boolean, or a String.
`Object.keys` is ToObject and then OrdinaryOwnPropertyKeys, so a string's
answer is its index keys and a Number's is empty. `push` and `join` are
generic over an array-like, as the whole of `Array.prototype` is;
`callArrayNative` holds the rest of it. A missing argument is `undefined`
throughout.

`Number` and `Boolean` called as functions are their conversions;
`constructNative` is what `new` does instead. The four `Number`
predicates do **not** coerce — `Number.isNaN("NaN")` is `false` — while
every `Math` member does, through `toNumberValue`. `Math.max` and
`Math.min` coerce every argument first and then fold the library's binary
`tsMax`/`tsMin` from the identities its header names, `-∞` and `+∞`, so
the empty call answers an infinity and a NaN anywhere propagates.
`Math.pow` is `tsPow`, the same definition `**` is, and carries the same
limit on a non-integral exponent (#434).

`Number.prototype.toString` is the library's `toRadixString`, and the
`toFixed` family is the library's three formatters. Each arm keeps the
**specification's step order** where test262 observes it: a poisoned
argument is coerced, and so throws, before any range check; a non-finite
`this` short-circuits `toExponential` and `toPrecision` before their range
check but not `toFixed`, so `Infinity.toExponential(200)` is `Infinity`
while `NaN.toFixed(Infinity)` throws. `toLocaleString` is `toString()`:
there is no locale here, ECMA-402 being outside the epic. -/

/-- The `Object` reflection surface and `Function.prototype`'s four
methods: the half of the property protocol a script reaches by name.

It is a definition of its own rather than twenty-nine more arms of
`callNative` because `NativeFn` has sixty constructors, and a `match`
over all of them whose body is this large is one whose equation lemmas
the compiler cannot generate at all — `rw [callNative]` diverges, and so
does putting it in a simp set, which the reduction tests do.

The `Object` arms are ToObject, ToPropertyDescriptor,
FromPropertyDescriptor, SetIntegrityLevel, and the enumeration helpers
over those, each in the specification's own step order: a key is
converted before the receiver, every descriptor is read before any is
applied, and an own property is re-read before its value is taken. The
`Function` arms are 20.2.3's: `call` and `apply` differ only in how the
argument list is built, `bind` builds a `Callable.bound` whose `length`
and `name` are computed once, and `toString` answers the NativeFunction
form for every function, the bridge keeping no source text.

The arm for anything else is unreachable: `callNative` routes exactly
the twenty-nine constructors below here. -/

/-- The iteration surface: `%IteratorPrototype%[@@iterator]`, the Array
Iterator, and the two `Object` members that consume an iterable.

It is a definition of its own for `callReflectNative`'s reason —
`callNative`'s `match` is already past the depth at which Lean generates
equation lemmas — but it **is** in `tarski_eval`, because a closed
destructuring or a single `for`-`of` step must reduce without a local
lemma list, and seven arms are far below the ceiling.

The three constructors take ToObject of their receiver (23.1.3.19 step
1), so an array-like works and `Array.prototype.values.call({length: 1})`
iterates. `next` reads its length every step, which is what makes an
array that grows mid-iteration visit the new elements, and writes
`undefined` into `[[IteratedArrayLike]]` when it runs out, which is what
keeps an exhausted iterator done.

The String Iterator is here too, and it is the one walk that steps by
**code point** rather than by code unit: `JsString.codePointAt?` answers
the point starting at an index and how many units it took, which is
exactly the step 22.1.5.1.1 takes.

The arm for anything else is unreachable: `callNative` routes exactly
the nine constructors below here. -/

computes is one of `Js/String/Ops.lean`'s total functions.

/-- GetPrototypeFromConstructor (10.1.13) and OrdinaryObjectCreate on
its answer: the instance is linked to **NewTarget's** `prototype`
property when that is an object, and to the intrinsic `fallback`
otherwise. Reading NewTarget rather than the function being run is what
makes `class B extends A {}` produce a `B` — `A`'s body allocates, but
`B` is the NewTarget the allocation sees.

The fallback is the specification's: the intrinsic prototype of the
constructor doing the work, so `Error.prototype` for an `Error` and
`Object.prototype` for an ordinary function. That is a change from the
null this used to link to, and it is observable exactly once, as
`Test/Tarski/ObjectsTest.lean` pins it: after `F.prototype = 1`, a
`new F()` is still an `Object`. -/

/-- The rest of the `Array` surface: the whole of 23.1.3 but the four
iterator members (#394), plus `Array.from` and `Array.of`.

It is a definition of its own rather than twenty-nine more arms of
`callNative` for the reason `callReflectNative` is one — `NativeFn` has
eighty-nine constructors now, and a `match` over all of them with a body
this size is one whose equation lemmas the compiler cannot generate.

Each arm is in its section's own step order — ToObject first, then
LengthOfArrayLike, then the argument coercions — so a poisoned `valueOf`
runs where the specification runs it. Every one of them is **generic over
an array-like**: the four internal methods are `getProp`, `hasProperty`,
`setProp`, and `deleteProp`, and a result is filled in with
CreateDataPropertyOrThrow, which works on a species-constructed
non-array too.

The arm for anything else is unreachable: `callNative` routes exactly the
twenty-nine constructors below here. -/

/-- ClassDefinitionEvaluation (15.7.14), in the specification's order.

The class's own name is an immutable binding in a scope of its own, so
the body can name the class and no outer binding is shadowed for anyone
else; the private names are cells in that same scope. The heritage is
evaluated there, which is why `class A extends A {}` sees its own dead
zone.

`extends` gives two different parents: the *prototype* parent, read off
the superclass's `prototype` property, and the *constructor* parent, the
superclass itself — which is what makes a static method inherited. A
class with no heritage gets `Object.prototype` and no constructor
parent; `extends null` gets neither, so `new` on it can only succeed
through the return-override trick. -/

empty answers `acc` unchanged, and a `break` throws the value it can see.

object's snapshotted keys. A key is visited only if it is **still** an
own property when its turn comes and that property is enumerable — a key
the body deleted is skipped, and one the body added is not visited at
all, the list having been taken when the object was reached. A key whose
property is merely non-enumerable still shadows the prototypes', which is
why it joins `visited` either way and a deleted one does not.

This recurses on the key list, which is data; the step to the next object
is `forInNext`'s, and that is the only part a proof unfolds with `rw`. -/

close, and a throw from the step never reaches here — `iteratorStep`
throws for the iterator, which closes nothing.
