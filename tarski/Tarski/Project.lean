/-! The correspondence projection: an evaluator outcome read in the
model's terms.

`thales` proves a property of a *model* — a `JsM α` built out of
the `Js` library. The evaluator answers something else entirely: an
`Option (Except Completion (Option Value) × Heap)`, a run that may not
terminate, may end abruptly, and carries a whole heap with it. This
module is the one function that reads the second as the first, so that a
per-declaration correspondence obligation can be *stated*: the evaluator's
answer to a call, projected, equals the model's answer, injected.

**What the projection claims.** `Outcome α` has three constructors and
the third is the point. `value a` says the run returned something the
reader recognized as an `a`; `error k` says it threw an object whose
`[[Prototype]]` is one of the seven `Error` prototypes, `k` being that
kind's `name`. Everything else is `other` — a `break` that crossed the
top, a thrown primitive, a thrown object of any other shape, a run whose
statement produced no value, a value the reader refused. **No model
equals `other`**: `Outcome.ofModel` only ever answers `value` or `error`,
so an obligation that lands on `other` is a failed correspondence rather
than a vacuous one. Divergence is not an `Outcome` at all: the evaluator's
`none` projects to `none`, and a model makes no claim about a run that
never ends, which is what `@ensures`'s partial correctness already says.

**The seven kinds, by prototype.** `errorKindOf` asks the heap for the
thrown object's `[[Prototype]]` and compares it against the seven fixed
`protoRef`s — a table lookup, not a `name` property read, so a script
that assigns `RangeError.prototype.name = "Nope"` cannot change what a
throw projects to, and neither can a `name` own property on the thrown
object. A subclass instance carries its *own* class's prototype, so
`class E extends RangeError {}; throw new E()` is `other`: the model has
no kind for it, and #478 records that as a residual site rather than a
correspondence.

**A private field is found by name, through the constructor's closure.**
The heap alone cannot: `Tarski/Value.lean` makes a Private Name a *cell
reference*, so the `#lo` on an instance is stored under a number, not
under the string `"#lo"`. The spelling is bound in the class's own scope,
which the constructor closed over — so the walk is instance → `proto` →
its own `constructor` property → that closure's `env` → `Env.lookup` of
`"#" ++ name` → `Obj.getPrivate`. Its one assumption is that
`prototype.constructor` is intact; a program that overwrote it reads
`none`, which projects to `other`, which is the safe direction.

This module holds meaning and nothing else: no engine, no syntax, no
artifact. A per-class reader is built *out of* `readOwnField` and
`readPrivateField`, and it is built on the far side of this package's
boundary, by whatever produced the model. -/
