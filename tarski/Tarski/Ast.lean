/-! The abstract syntax of the evaluated fragment.

Every constructor names the ESTree node it decodes from, so this file,
`Tarski/Decode.lean`, and `schemas/tarski-estree.schema.json` can be read
against one another. A node kind outside this file is not a runtime
error: `Decode` refuses it as `unsupported`, and that is the only place
the word appears.

Strict mode only. A parameter is a `Param`: a target, an optional
default, and a `rest` flag. The target is a `Pattern` — an
`Identifier`, an `ArrayPattern`, or an `ObjectPattern` — and one
`Pattern` serves every binding position and every assignment pattern
too, a `Declarator`, a `CatchClause`, and a `for` head included. `var` is
here, so hoisting covers two scopes at once: `let`, `const`, and function
declarations are instantiated per block, while a `var` is hoisted to the
enclosing function or script and initialized to `undefined` there, with
no dead zone. `throw` and `try`, labels, `break`/`continue`, `for`,
`switch`, and `do`/`while` — the three remaining breakable statements —
are here, and so are parameter defaults and `arguments`, and so are
`delete`, `in`, and `for`-`in`, which are `[[Delete]]`,
`[[HasProperty]]`, and EnumerateObjectProperties and so belong with the
property protocol #389 defines rather than with the loops; `new.target`
is #486's.

**The iteration protocol's syntax is here**: `for`-`of` (`forOfStmt`,
whose head is the same `ForInLeft` a `for`-`in` has), spread in an array
literal, a call, a `new`, a `super` call, and an object literal
(`Expr.spread`, `PropDef.spread`), an array literal's holes
(`Expr.hole`), and destructuring — binding patterns with defaults,
elisions, and rest in declarations, parameters, `catch` clauses, and
loop heads, plus the assignment form (`Expr.assignPattern`). Generators
and `for await` are not: they stay refused by name in the decoder.

**Templates are here**, tagged and untagged, the tagged form carrying a
site number the decoder assigns so that the template object can be cached
per Parse Node. So is every object-literal member but spread: a
shorthand, a computed key, a numeric key, a method, a getter, a setter,
and `__proto__:`, all of them `PropDef`s over a `PropKey`. A computed
*class* key is still refused by name — a method's or a field's key is a
`ClassKey`, a public spelling or a private name, which is #384's shape, and widening it is not this file's business.

**Classes are here**: declarations and expressions, a constructor,
public and private instance fields, methods, getters and setters,
`static` members, `extends`, and `super`. What a class may spell and this
AST may not is refused by name in `Tarski/Decode.lean` — a computed key,
a static block, an `accessor` field, a decorator, `new.target`, `#x in
o`, and `super.x = v` — because each is real syntax with semantics of its
own rather than a shorthand for something here. Later slices add
constructors; they do not reshape the ones here. -/

  to `undefined` when the function or script is instantiated, so a read
  before the declarator is `undefined` rather than the dead zone's

  these it never coerces its operand, and it is the one prefix operator
  an unresolvable identifier does not throw under: `typeof nope` is
  `"undefined"` where `nope` alone is a `ReferenceError`. -/
  | typeof
  /-- ESTree `UnaryExpression` with `operator: "void"`. It evaluates its
  operand — for the effects — and answers `undefined`; the value is never
  coerced, so `void {}` does not run ToPrimitive. `~` is the other
  spelling ESTree puts here and is not in the slice; `delete` is
  `Expr.delete`, because it takes a *reference* rather than a value. -/

/-- The two update operators, which read a target, add or subtract one,
and write it back. ESTree gives them a node of their own, because the
value of the expression depends on which side the operator was on. -/

/-- The infix operators: the arithmetic four plus `%`, the four
relations, and the two strict-equality tests. Loose `==` is absent — it
coerces both operands by rules this slice does not model. -/

  addition otherwise. -/

  | sub
  /-- `*`. -/
  | mul
  /-- `/`. -/

  /-- `**`. ESTree spells it as a `BinaryExpression` like the rest; its
  right-associativity is the parser's business and is already resolved by
  the time the tree arrives. The meaning is `Number::exponentiate`, which
  is the library's `tsPow` — the same definition `Math.pow` has. Named
  `exponent` because `.exp` and `.pow` are spellings the arithmetic
  boundary check bans. -/

  /-- `>=`. String order on two strings, numeric otherwise. -/
  | ge
  /-- `===`. -/
  | strictEq
  /-- `!==`. -/
  | strictNe
  /-- `instanceof`. Neither operand is coerced: the left is compared
  against a prototype chain by identity, and the right must be a
  function. -/
  | instanceof
  /-- `in`. HasProperty over ToPropertyKey of the left operand, so the
  right must be an object. Like `instanceof` it does not coerce, and for
  the same reason: it is a question about a reference. -/
  | «in»
deriving Repr, DecidableEq, Inhabited

/-- The short-circuiting infix operators. They are not `BinaryOp`
because they do not evaluate both operands, let alone coerce them: the
value of `a && b` is one of the two operands, not a boolean. `??` is
absent — it is nullish-specific and arrives with optional chaining. -/

property key at all: it is resolved through the scope chain like an
identifier, and the element it names lives in a list of its own on the
object. -/

TRV of 12.9.6. `cooked` is `none` when the raw text holds an escape the
cooked grammar refuses — which a tagged template admits, because its tag
may want the raw text, and an untagged one does not, because there the
escape is a parse error. `raw` has its line terminators normalized, as
TRV requires: a `<CR><LF>` and a lone `<CR>` are both `<LF>`. -/

/-- Expressions. `undefLit` has no ESTree node of its own: `undefined` is
an `Identifier` there, and the decoder reads it as this literal, which is
what a strict-mode script's non-writable global binding means. -/
inductive Expr where
  /-- ESTree `Literal` with a number value. -/
  | numLit (value : Float)
  /-- ESTree `Literal` with a string value, **decoded from its `raw`
  source text** rather than from `value`: Lean's JSON reader replaces a
  lone surrogate with U+FFFD, so `"\uD800"` would reach the evaluator as
  a different string than the one the source names. The schema requires
  `raw`, so the decoder reads the escape grammar itself and cross-checks
  the well-formed case against `value`. -/

  /-- ESTree `Literal` with a boolean value. -/

  /-- ESTree `ConditionalExpression`. -/
  | cond (test consequent alternate : Expr)
  /-- ESTree `MemberExpression` with `computed: false`. -/
  | member (object : Expr) (name : String)
  /-- ESTree `MemberExpression` with `computed: true`. The key is an
  expression, converted with ToPropertyKey when the access runs. -/
  | index (object : Expr) (key : Expr)
  /-- ESTree `MemberExpression` whose `property` is a `PrivateIdentifier`
  and whose `computed` is false; `name` is ESTree's, without the `#`. -/
  | privateMember (object : Expr) (name : String)
  /-- ESTree `MemberExpression` whose `object` is `Super`, with
  `computed: false`. The property is read off the home object's
  prototype with the current `this` as the receiver. -/
  | superMember (name : String)
  /-- ESTree `MemberExpression` whose `object` is `Super`, with
  `computed: true`. -/
  | superIndex (key : Expr)
  /-- ESTree `CallExpression` whose `callee` is `Super`. -/
  | superCall (args : List Expr)
  /-- ESTree `CallExpression`. A `member` or `index` callee passes its
  object as the receiver; any other callee passes `undefined`. -/
  | call (callee : Expr) (args : List Expr)
  /-- ESTree `NewExpression`. -/
  | new (callee : Expr) (args : List Expr)
  /-- ESTree `ArrayExpression`. An element may be `Expr.hole`, which is
  ESTree's JSON `null` and the source's elision, or `Expr.spread`; both
  are ordinary elements of this list, which is ESTree's own shape and
  what keeps every `.arrayLit [.numLit 1.0]` spelling standing. -/
  | arrayLit (elements : List Expr)
  /-- ESTree `ObjectExpression`, its members in source order. Every
  member form is here, spread included (`PropDef.spread`). A duplicate
  key is a redefinition and the last one wins. -/
  | objectLit (props : List PropDef)
  /-- ESTree `TemplateLiteral` outside a tag. `strings` are the quasis'
  cooked values and there is one more of them than there are `exprs`, so
  a substitution-free template is one string and no expressions. A
  substitution is ToString of its value, and an invalid escape is a parse
  error rather than a `none` cooked value, which is why the strings are
  not `TemplateString`s. -/
  | template (strings : List String) (exprs : List Expr)
  /-- ESTree `TaggedTemplateExpression`. `tag` is the callee and is
  resolved the way a call's is, so a member tag passes its object as
  `this`. `site` is the decoder's number for this template's Parse Node,
  in document order, and is what GetTemplateObject's `[[TemplateMap]]`
  caches by: one site called twice hands the tag the identical object,
  and two sites with the same text do not. `new tag\`x\`` is a `new`
  whose callee is this node. -/
  | taggedTemplate (tag : Expr) (site : Nat) (strings : List TemplateString)
      (exprs : List Expr)
  /-- ESTree `FunctionExpression`. A name binds only inside the
  function's own scope, which is what lets an anonymous-looking
  expression recurse. -/
  | funcExpr (name : Option String) (params : List Param) (body : List Stmt)
  /-- ESTree `ArrowFunctionExpression`. An arrow has no `this` of its
  own, so `this` inside one is an ordinary lexical lookup. -/
  | arrow (params : List Param) (body : ArrowBody)
  /-- ESTree `AssignmentExpression` with `operator: "="`. -/
  | assign (target : Target) (value : Expr)
  /-- ESTree `AssignmentExpression` with one of the five arithmetic
  compound operators, `+= -= *= /= %=`, carried here as the `BinaryOp`
  they apply. The decoder refuses every other compound spelling by name:
  `**=` is not mapped onto `BinaryOp.exponent` yet, and the shifts and
  the bitwise and logical assignments need ToInt32 or short-circuiting,
  which are later slices. -/
  | compoundAssign (op : BinaryOp) (target : Target) (value : Expr)
  /-- ESTree `UpdateExpression`. `isPrefix` is ESTree's `prefix`: the
  prefix form answers the new number, the postfix form the old one, and
  both coerce the target's value with ToNumber before stepping it. -/
  | update (op : UpdateOp) (isPrefix : Bool) (target : Target)
  /-- ESTree `ClassExpression`. -/
  | classExpr (cls : ClassDef)
  /-- ESTree `UnaryExpression` with `operator: "delete"`. It is an
  expression of its own rather than a `UnaryOp` because it takes a
  *reference*: a `member` or `index` operand is `[[Delete]]` on the base,
  a bare identifier is the strict-mode early error reported at the point
  of use, and anything else is evaluated for its effects and answers
  `true`. A `super` member operand is a decoder refusal. -/
  | delete (operand : Expr)
  /-- ESTree `AssignmentExpression` with `operator: "="` whose `left` is
  an `ArrayPattern` or an `ObjectPattern`: DestructuringAssignmentEvaluation
  (13.15.5), whose value is the *right* operand's. A constructor of its
  own rather than a widening of `assign`'s `Target`, which every program
  here spells with a dot-constructor. -/
  | assignPattern (pattern : Pattern) (value : Expr)
  /-- ESTree `SpreadElement`. Legal only as an `arrayLit` element or a
  `call`, `new`, or `superCall` argument, where the list evaluation
  iterates it; the decoder never places one anywhere else, so reaching
  `evalExpr` with one is the `SyntaxError` the message table lists. -/
  | spread (argument : Expr)
  /-- An `ArrayExpression` element that is JSON `null`: an elision.
  ArrayAccumulation counts it and defines nothing, so `[1, , 2]` has
  length 3 and no `1` key. Outside an array literal it is the same
  `SyntaxError` `spread` is. -/
  | hole

/-- ESTree `Property.key`. A `name` is what an `Identifier` key, a string
`Literal` key, and a shorthand's own name all decode to; a `computed` key
is `[e]`, and so is a *numeric* `Literal` key — `{ 1.5: x }` gets its key
from ToPropertyKey at evaluation rather than from a second spelling of
`Number::toString` at decode time. -/
inductive PropKey where
  /-- A written key, already a string. -/
  | name (s : String)
  /-- A computed key: ToPropertyKey of the expression's value. -/
  | computed (e : Expr)

/-- One member of an object literal, in source order. -/
inductive PropDef where
  /-- ESTree `Property` with `kind: "init"` and `method: false`. A
  shorthand is one of these too: its `value` is its own `Identifier`. -/
  | init (key : PropKey) (value : Expr)
  /-- ESTree `Property` with `method: true`, or with `kind` `"get"` or
  `"set"`. MethodDefinitionEvaluation with the literal itself as
  `[[HomeObject]]`, so `super.x` inside one reads through the literal's
  prototype. -/
  | method (kind : MethodKind) (key : PropKey) (params : List Param) (body : List Stmt)
  /-- ESTree `SpreadElement` as an object-literal member:
  CopyDataProperties (7.3.26) into the literal with no excluded keys, so
  every own enumerable key of the source — string and symbol both — is
  *defined* on the literal rather than written to it. -/
  | spread (value : Expr)
  /-- A non-computed, non-shorthand `__proto__` key: B.3.1's `__proto__`
  Property Names in Object Initializers. The value is evaluated, and when
  it is an object or `null` it becomes `[[Prototype]]`; otherwise nothing
  happens and no property is made. -/
  | proto (value : Expr)

/-- An arrow function's body: `expression: true` in ESTree means the
concise form, whose value is the expression's. -/
inductive ArrowBody where
  /-- The concise body: `x => x + 1`. -/
  | expr (value : Expr)
  /-- The block body: `x => { return x + 1; }`. -/
  | block (body : List Stmt)

/-- What an assignment writes to. An inductive rather than three
constructors of `Expr`, which is what let compound assignment and the
update operators add operators and not target forms. -/
inductive Target where
  /-- ESTree `Identifier`. -/
  | ident (name : String)
  /-- ESTree `MemberExpression` with `computed: false`. -/
  | member (object : Expr) (name : String)
  /-- ESTree `MemberExpression` with `computed: true`. -/
  | index (object : Expr) (key : Expr)
  /-- ESTree `MemberExpression` with a `PrivateIdentifier` property. A
  write to a private element is not a property write: the element must
  already be on the object, or the write is a `TypeError`. -/
  | privateMember (object : Expr) (name : String)

/-- ESTree `ArrayPattern`, `ObjectPattern`, and the leaf they bottom out
in. One type serves a *binding* pattern and an *assignment* pattern
both, because ESTree gives them one node family and 14.3.3 and 13.15.5
are one walk; what differs is how a leaf is written, which is `BindMode`
in `Tarski/Eval.lean`, and that a binding position admits only an
identifier leaf — which the decoder enforces rather than a second type. -/
inductive Pattern where
  /-- An ESTree `Identifier` or, in an assignment pattern, a
  `MemberExpression`. -/
  | target (t : Target)
  /-- ESTree `ArrayPattern`. A `none` element is an elision, which steps
  the iterator and binds nothing; `rest` is the `RestElement`'s
  `argument`, which may itself be a pattern. -/
  | array (elements : List (Option PatternElem)) (rest : Option Pattern)
  /-- ESTree `ObjectPattern`. `rest` is a `RestElement` whose argument
  the grammar requires to be a leaf in both pattern families. -/
  | object (props : List PatternProp) (rest : Option Target)

/-- One element of an `ArrayPattern`: a target, plus the `right` of the
`AssignmentPattern` when the element is written with a default. -/
structure PatternElem where
  /-- The element's target. -/
  target : Pattern
  /-- The `AssignmentPattern`'s `right`, or `none`. -/
  default : Option Expr

/-- One `Property` of an `ObjectPattern`. A shorthand `{ a }` and a
defaulted shorthand `{ a = 1 }` both decode to the key `.name "a"` with
the target `.target (.ident "a")`; a computed or numeric key is a
`PropKey.computed`, exactly as an object literal's is. -/
structure PatternProp where
  /-- ESTree `Property.key`. -/
  key : PropKey
  /-- The property's target. -/
  target : Pattern
  /-- The `AssignmentPattern`'s `right`, or `none`. -/
  default : Option Expr

/-- Statements. -/
inductive Stmt where
  /-- ESTree `ExpressionStatement`. -/
  | exprStmt (value : Expr)
  /-- ESTree `VariableDeclaration`. -/
  | varDecl (kind : DeclKind) (declarators : List Declarator)
  /-- ESTree `FunctionDeclaration`. Hoisted to the top of the block that
  contains it, and initialized there, so it may be called before its
  text and two of them may call each other. -/
  | funcDecl (name : String) (params : List Param) (body : List Stmt)
  /-- ESTree `ReturnStatement`; `none` returns `undefined`. -/
  | returnStmt (argument : Option Expr)
  /-- ESTree `IfStatement`; `alternate` is the `else` arm. -/
  | ifStmt (test : Expr) (consequent : Stmt) (alternate : Option Stmt)
  /-- ESTree `WhileStatement`. -/
  | whileStmt (test : Expr) (body : Stmt)
  /-- ESTree `DoWhileStatement`. The body runs before the first test, a
  `continue` goes to the test rather than out of the loop, and the whole
  thing is a breakable statement like `while`. The body is first here
  because it is first in the source. -/
  | doWhileStmt (body : Stmt) (test : Expr)
  /-- ESTree `ForStatement`. The head's three parts are each optional,
  so `for (;;)` is three `none`s. A `let` head gets a fresh binding per
  iteration — copied after the body and before the update, so a closure
  the body made keeps that iteration's value — while a `const` or `var`
  head does not. -/
  | forStmt (init : Option ForInit) (test : Option Expr) (update : Option Expr)
      (body : Stmt)
  /-- ESTree `SwitchStatement`. The whole case block is one declarative
  scope, instantiated before any test runs; selection is strict equality
  in source order, a selected clause falls through into the ones after
  it, and `default` may sit anywhere among them. -/
  | switchStmt (discriminant : Expr) (cases : List SwitchCase)
  /-- ESTree `EmptyStatement`, the bare `;`. It completes empty, so it
  leaves the running completion value standing. -/
  | empty
  /-- ESTree `BlockStatement`: its own declarative scope. -/
  | block (body : List Stmt)
  /-- ESTree `ThrowStatement`. -/
  | throwStmt (argument : Expr)
  /-- ESTree `TryStatement`. `handler` is the `CatchClause` and
  `finalizer` the `finally` block's statements; at least one of the two
  is present, which the decoder enforces because `try { }` alone does not
  parse. -/
  | tryStmt (block : List Stmt) (handler : Option CatchClause)
      (finalizer : Option (List Stmt))
  /-- ESTree `LabeledStatement`. A label is not a scope: it is a target,
  and the statement it names is evaluated with the label set that reaches
  it, which is what lets a `continue` name a loop from inside a nested
  one. -/
  | labeled (label : String) (body : Stmt)
  /-- ESTree `BreakStatement`; `none` is the unlabelled form, which the
  innermost loop catches. -/
  | breakStmt (label : Option String)
  /-- ESTree `ContinueStatement`; `none` is the unlabelled form. -/
  | continueStmt (label : Option String)
  /-- ESTree `ForInStatement`. EnumerateObjectProperties over the right
  operand's own and inherited enumerable string keys; a `let` or `const`
  head gets a fresh binding per iteration, so two closures the body makes
  see two cells. A nullish right operand runs the body not at all. -/
  | forInStmt (left : ForInLeft) (right : Expr) (body : Stmt)
  /-- ESTree `ForOfStatement` with `await: false`. GetIterator of the
  right operand, one IteratorStepValue per iteration, and IteratorClose
  on every exit but exhaustion and a throw from the iterator itself. The
  head is a `ForInLeft`, the two loops' heads being the same production. -/
  | forOfStmt (left : ForInLeft) (right : Expr) (body : Stmt)
  /-- ESTree `ClassDeclaration`. Hoisted like a `let`: the cell exists
  from the block's first statement and is in its temporal dead zone until
  the declaration runs, so `new A(); class A {}` is a `ReferenceError`.
  The binding is writable, unlike the class's own inner name. -/
  | classDecl (name : String) (cls : ClassDef)

/-- The head of a `for`-`in` *or* a `for`-`of`: what each key or value is
bound to. A declaration head is exactly one declarator with no
initializer — the sloppy `for (var x = 1 in o)` form is a decoder
refusal — an assignment target is any of the `Target` shapes, and an
`ArrayPattern` or `ObjectPattern` head is
DestructuringAssignmentEvaluation once per iteration. -/
inductive ForInLeft where
  /-- A `VariableDeclaration` in the head, one declarator, no `init`.
  The declarator's `id` may be a binding pattern. -/
  | decl (kind : DeclKind) (target : Pattern)
  /-- An assignment target in the head: `for (k in o)`, `for (o.p in q)`. -/
  | target (t : Target)
  /-- An assignment *pattern* in the head: `for ([a, b] of xs)`. A
  `.pattern (.target t)` is never produced and would mean what
  `.target t` means. -/
  | pattern (p : Pattern)

/-- ESTree `ForStatement.init`: a declaration, an expression evaluated
for its effect, or nothing. A declaration head is its own scope — the
loop's — which is why the loop, and not the block around it, allocates
the cells. -/
inductive ForInit where
  /-- A `VariableDeclaration` in the head. -/
  | decl (kind : DeclKind) (declarators : List Declarator)
  /-- An expression in the head, whose value is dropped. -/
  | expr (value : Expr)

/-- ESTree `SwitchCase`. `test` is `none` for the `default` clause, and
`body` is the clause's `consequent` — the statements between this label
and the next one, which are not a block and not a scope of their own. -/
structure SwitchCase where
  /-- ESTree `SwitchCase.test`; `none` is `default`. -/
  test : Option Expr
  /-- ESTree `SwitchCase.consequent`. -/
  body : List Stmt

/-- ESTree `CatchClause`. `param` is `none` for the optional-binding
form, `catch { }`. The parameter's bindings are mutable and live in a
scope of their own, holding nothing but themselves, which is why they do
not collide with same-named bindings outside. -/
structure CatchClause where
  /-- ESTree `CatchClause.param`, a binding pattern or nothing. -/
  param : Option Pattern

the `AssignmentPattern`'s `right`, and it is evaluated only when the

errors are outside this epic — so `const x;` binds `undefined` here where
an engine refuses the script. -/
