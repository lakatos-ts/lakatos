/-! What is in `tarski_eval`, and what may never be.

The set is now the thing a correspondence proof calls, so its membership
is part of the interface rather than a detail of seven test files. The
rule `Tarski/Simp.lean` states is checked here: a definition that
recurses on *syntax* is an ordinary member; a definition that recurses on
a *loop* is not in the set at all; a definition that recurses on the
*heap* is in it only as a guarded simproc, never as a plain unfolding.

The second list is the one that matters. A loop arm in a simp set is not
a slow proof, it is a proof that never comes back, and the failure is
silent until some unrelated obligation stalls. Naming the four heap
recursions here as well pins that they went in *behind their guards*: a
plain `attribute [tarski_eval] construct` would flip the second `#eval`
and nothing else in the suite would notice until a `new` under a symbolic
argument ran forever.

`AxiomsTest` uses the same shape for the same reason — a property of the
environment, read back out of it. -/
