# The failure list for the PR-gated slice

Written 2026-09-15 against test262 at `419d3e0a2273ba01a3bfcbec423f2801425b8e93`
(`tarski/test262/pin.json`), from one run of

```bash
node dist/test262/cli.js --slice-file test262/slice.txt
```

Every failing test in `tarski/test262/slice.txt` is classified here — the
harness, the 27 language directories the thales emitter maps (#383), the
three built-ins directories #382 added, the two global parsers #388
added, the two class directories #384 added, the fifteen declaration
instantiation, jump, and `arguments` directories #393 added, the two
`Object` and `Function` directories #389 added, the three template and
object-literal directories #395 added, the seven `Symbol`, `JSON`, and
`*Error` directories #392 added, `test/built-ins/String`, which #391
added, the ten iterator, `for`-`of`, spread, and array-literal
directories #394 added, and the forty-eight `Array` directories #390
added — and
`tarski/frontend/tests/test262-failures.test.ts` holds this file and
`tarski/test262/expected.json` together: each directory named here is a key
of that file, every directory with a positive `fail` count appears, and the
`fails` column sums to exactly that count. So a ratchet that moves a count
has to re-classify what moved.

The four classes:

- **builtin** — a built-in or an intrinsic the realm does not have yet. The
  test's own subject is evaluated correctly, or would be if the name
  resolved.
- **protocol** — a runtime construct the evaluator does not model and the
  decoder cannot see, so it reaches evaluation and answers wrongly rather
  than refusing.
- **out-of-scope** — what #376 excludes: `eval`, the `Function`
  constructor, generators, typed arrays, `Date`, and the rest.
- **bug** — a real defect, filed as its own issue. `owner` is that issue.

`owner` is the issue the row waits on. Nothing here waits on #383, on
#382, on #388, on #384, on #393, on #389, on #395, on #392, or on #391: no failure
in the slice is caused by the statements and operators #383 added, none
is a `Math`, `Number`, or `Boolean` member answering the wrong number,
**not one row is a conversion between a Number and a String answering the
wrong thing**, **none is a class evaluating wrongly**, **none is
declaration instantiation, a parameter's dead zone, a default's scope,
`arguments`, a `switch`, a label, a jump, or `do`/`while` answering
wrongly**, **not one row is a property descriptor, an own-key order, an
enumerability, a `delete`, an `in`, a `for`-`in`, or an `Object` or
`Function` member answering the wrong thing**, **none is an object
literal's members running out of order or defining the wrong thing, or a
template building the wrong string or the wrong template object**, and
**not one row is a symbol, a symbol-keyed property, a JSON text, or an
`Error`'s `cause` answering the wrong thing** — the 118 rows that waited
on #392 are gone, and no row has replaced them under that number — and
**not one row is a `String` member, a String exotic object, or a
code-unit answer — `length`, an index, an order, a surrogate pair —
answering the wrong thing**. The 207 rows that waited on #391 are gone:
the String wrapper object exists, and a string is a sequence of UTF-16
code units. And **not one row is a member of `Array.prototype` answering
wrongly, a hole read as a value, a `length` grown or truncated by the
wrong amount, or a species allocation building the wrong thing** — the
rows that waited on #390 are gone.

Nothing waits on #394 either: `for`-`of`, spread, destructuring, and the
three iterators answer correctly. Two seams the merge of #390 and #394
left are filed rather than classified under a closed issue — #531,
`Array.from` never asking for `@@iterator`, and #532,
`%IteratorPrototype%` carrying no `@@toStringTag` — and #533 is the
destructuring evaluation order the two order tests see.

The 1,644 failures below, by owner: 1,019 what #376 excludes (`eval`,
`Date`, `RegExp`, `Proxy`, `Reflect`, typed arrays, the keyed
collections, explicit resource management, the `Iterator` constructor and
its helpers, `Error.prototype.stack`, `JSON.rawJSON` and the reviver's
source text, `Array.fromAsync`, the `Function` constructor's semantics,
and `nativeFunctionMatcher.js`, which matches source text with a regular
expression), 191 the global object (#487), 151 the transcendental `Math`
members (#434), 110 the six ES2023 `Array.prototype` members (#513), 70
the global `isNaN` and `isFinite` (#441), 18 ToLength of an infinite
`length` (#514), 16 the Unicode character database (#518), 14
`Array.from` over an iterable (#531), 13 `Math.clz32`/`imul` (#440), 10
the `@@split`, `@@replace`, and `@@match` lookups the `String` methods
skip (#523), 5 `Array.prototype[@@unscopables]` (#524), 5 `Math.random`
(#445), 2 `%IteratorPrototype%`'s `@@toStringTag` (#532), and 20 the nine
filed defects (#436, #460, #496, #499, #512, #516, #520, #522, and
#533).

**Two class evaluations were wrong** when the class directories were
first scored and are not wrong now. `super[super()]` read the key before
the `this` binding, where 13.3.7.2 reads the binding first, so the
derived constructor's dead zone was not reached; that is `superBase` in
`Tarski/Eval.lean`, and `ClassesTest` pins it. The other was a bridge
limit rather than an evaluator one: tsc refuses `a?.b.#c`, which is valid
JavaScript, so four tests under `class/elements` are **harness errors**
rather than failures and appear in no row below. #472 owns them.

**The two limits #391 left are filed rather than hidden.** Case mapping
is ASCII-only and `normalize` validates its form and answers its input,
because Lean has no Unicode character database and shipping one is a
slice of its own; the sixteen case-mapping tests and the three
`normalize` results wait on #518. And a property key is still a Lean
`String`, so `JsString.toKey` is lossy at a lone surrogate and
`o["\uD800"]` and `o["\uFFFD"]` are one key; no test in the slice
exercises it, and #519 owns it.

**Three defects an earlier slice found are filed rather than fixed.**
`estree.ts` gives a `static constructor() {}` the ESTree kind of a class
constructor and drops its `static` flag (#496), which two
`grammar-static-ctor-meth-valid.js` tests reach now that a function has a
`hasOwnProperty` to call; and the bridge drops the parentheses that keep
NamedEvaluation from naming `(fn) = function () {}` (#499). The third is
older: a numeric literal that overflows to `Infinity` reaches Lean as
JSON `null` (#460).

The divergence #436 records is now observable and is now a row of its
own: `applyCoercing` runs ToPrimitive on both operands before ToNumber on
either, where 13.15.3 converts the left operand fully first for every
operator but `+`. It takes a Symbol operand to see, so the four
`order-of-evaluation` tests under `division`, `modulus`,
`multiplication`, and `subtraction` reach it for the first time in this
slice; `addition`'s passes, `+` being the one operator whose order this
matches. Fixing it is #436's, not this slice's.

**The ten directories #394 added are 600 pass, 46 fail, and 149
unsupported.** `statements/for-of` is 453 pass and 37 fail across its own
directory and its `dstr` subtree — the subtree itself is 403 and **0** —
and not one of the 37 is the loop: 18 are typed arrays, 10 the keyed
collections, 6 `eval`, 2 `using` declarations, and 1 `Proxy`. The three
`Array.prototype.pop` rows that were among them before #390 are gone.
`expressions/array` is 50 pass and 0 fail, `expressions/new` 54 and 0,
`ArrayIteratorPrototype` 9 and 9 — those 9 failures typed arrays and
nothing else — and the four `Array.prototype` iterator members 28 and 0.
**Every other directory's `dstr` subtree ratcheted with them**, and the
String iterator cleared `String/prototype/Symbol.iterator` to 6 pass and
0 fail.

**The forty-eight `Array` directories #390 added are 2,579 pass and 271
fail**, with 108 unsupported and 124 not run — 88 `async`
`Array.fromAsync` tests and 36 `noStrict` ones, neither of which this
epic runs. Not one of the 271 is a member of `Array.prototype` answering
the wrong thing: 110 are the six ES2023 members this slice does not write
— `findLast`, `findLastIndex`, `toReversed`, `toSorted`, `toSpliced`, and
`with`, which are #513's; 107 are what #376 excludes, `Proxy`, `Date`,
regular expressions, typed arrays, `isConstructor.js`, `eval`,
`Array.fromAsync`, and `Reflect` among them; 18 are ToLength of an
infinite `length` (#514); 14 are `Array.from` never asking for
`@@iterator` (#531); 7 are the global object (#487); 5 are
`Array.prototype[@@unscopables]` (#524); 5 are the global `isNaN`
(#441); 2 are ArraySetLength's double coercion (#520); 2 are the
`Infinity` literal (#460); and 1 is a transcendental `Math` member
(#434).

**`test/built-ins/String` is 940 pass and 132 fail** over 41 rows, with
148 unsupported and three not run. Not one of the 132 is a `String`
member answering the wrong thing: 101 are what #376 excludes, 77 of them
regular expressions; 16 are the Unicode character database (#518); 10 are
the `@@split`, `@@replace`, and `@@match` protocol lookups (#523); 3 are
the global object (#487); and 2 are a non-callable `@@toPrimitive`
falling through to OrdinaryToPrimitive (#516).

**The two `Object` and `Function` directories are 3,114 pass and 444
fail**, against 3,031 and 519 before this slice: the rows that reached
the rest of `Array.prototype` through `map` and `indexOf` are gone, and
so are the ones that waited on iterators — `Object.fromEntries` is 25
pass and 0 fail, `Object.groupBy` 14 and 0. Their 444: 289 what #376
excludes; 143 the global object, whose `this` at top level a third of
`Object`'s older tests reach for (#487); 9 `Math` members the library
does not model, read through `getOwnPropertyDescriptor` (#434); 2
`%IteratorPrototype%`'s missing `@@toStringTag` (#532); and 1
`Math.random` (#445).

**The `propertyHelper.js`-based tests run and pass**: `Math/abs` is 8 and
0, and `length.js`, `name.js`, and `prop-desc.js` under it are three of
them.

`test/harness` is 70 pass and 11 fail, against 61 and 18: `compareArray`
and `propertyHelper` reach the whole of `Array.prototype` now, and what
is left is the global object (6), typed arrays and `Date` (5).

**The seven directories #392 added are 340 pass, 122 fail, and 47
unsupported.** Of the 122, 107 are what #376 excludes —
`Error.prototype.stack`, which is not in the specification and is absent
by design; explicit resource management, which is the whole of
`SuppressedError`; `Proxy`; `JSON.rawJSON`, `JSON.isRawJSON`, and the
reviver's `context` argument; and `isConstructor.js`, which needs
`Reflect.construct` — 12 the global object (#487), 2 a defect #392 found
and filed (#512), and 1 `JSON.stringify` writing a lone surrogate as
U+FFFD rather than its `\u` escape, because the JSON text is a Lean
`String` (#522). **Not one is a symbol, a JSON text, or an `Error` member
answering the wrong thing.**
