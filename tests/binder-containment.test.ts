/**
 * The invariant: the prover's binder domain must CONTAIN the refuter's,
 * and on the special values — the infinities and NaN — the two must agree
 * exactly.
 *
 * The two engines read a finite endpoint differently and cannot be made to
 * agree there. lemma fixes its denotation in fast-check's total order over
 * doubles, where every double is distinct, -0 sits below 0, and an excluded
 * endpoint removes exactly one double by adjacency. The prover gets the same
 * interval as Lean hypotheses, where the comparisons are IEEE: they cannot
 * separate -0 from 0 and have no notion of adjacency. Containment in this
 * direction is what makes that divergence safe — a prover Theorem can then
 * never contradict a refuter counterexample, and the worst case is failing
 * to prove something the refuter could not falsify anyway.
 *
 * The special values admit no such slack: a property can be true on the
 * finite doubles and false at an infinity or NaN, so a prover domain that
 * admits one the refuter excludes proves a different statement, not a wider
 * one. An infinite endpoint therefore bounds against the literal infinity
 * (strictly when open, non-strictly when closed — IEEE comparison rejects
 * NaN either way), and both engines read any interval as NaN-free.
 *
 * Checking it needs no Lean: JavaScript's < and <= on `number` are the same
 * IEEE-754 binary64 comparisons as Lean's on `Float`, down to how they treat
 * the zeros. What the op strings MEAN on the Lean side is the one leg this
 * cannot see, and the number-binder case in `Test/ThalesEmit/RenderTest.lean`
 * pins that: which relation each op string renders as, and which side of it
 * the bound variable sits on.
