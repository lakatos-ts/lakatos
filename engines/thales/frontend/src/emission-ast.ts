// The declaration's own AST: the ESTree of its dependency closure, as
// tarski's parser bridge produced it.
//
// The emitter never writes a node. Each module's stripped text goes
// through the bridge once, and a declaration's closure is a *selection*
// of those documents' top-level statements — the constants it reads, the
// functions it calls, the classes it names, and itself — in module order.
// That is why the closure is computed from the bridge's identifiers
// rather than from the emission IR: the IR erases `const safeMathAbs =
// Math.abs` into a `builtin` node, so an IR walk would assemble a script
// that `ReferenceError`s where the source does not.
//
// A closure that cannot be closed has no AST at all. Authoring a
// `const local = imported;` node to bridge a renamed import is exactly
// what #480 forbids, so a renamed import, a name two of the closure's
// modules both declare, a name with no declaring statement, and a module
// the bridge could not parse each answer `undefined` instead.
