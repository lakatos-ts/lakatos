/-! The evaluator's monad.

`ExceptT Completion (StateT Heap Option)`: a run threads the heap, may
end abruptly with a `Completion`, and may not end at all. Divergence is
the `Option`'s `none` — it is never written by hand, because the only
thing that produces it is the bottom of the `partial_fixpoint` the
evaluator is defined by. A program that loops forever is not an error the
evaluator reports; it is a run no caller ever sees the end of, observed
only through a timeout.

The order of the two transformers is the whole of the design. Unfolded,
this stack is `Heap → Option (Except Completion α × Heap)`: an abrupt
completion carries the heap out beside it, so catching one keeps every
write the abrupt part performed. The other order,
`StateT Heap (ExceptT Completion Option)`, is
`Heap → Option (Except Completion (α × Heap))`, which pairs the heap with
the *value* and therefore drops it on the error side: a function's own
`return` would undo the function's writes, and a `catch` would roll the
heap back, neither of which JavaScript does. Divergence still swallows
both, because the `Option` is outside both of them.

`partial_fixpoint` has no monotonicity lemma for `tryCatch`, so a
recursive definition may not catch inline. Catching is instead an opaque
definition here with its own `@[partial_fixpoint_monotone]` lemma, and
there are exactly two: `catchReturn`, which a call site wraps its body
in, and `attempt`, which *reifies* a completion rather than choosing one
shape to swallow. Every other catch — a `try`, a `finally`, a loop's
`break`, a label's — is an ordinary `match` on what `attempt` answered,
inside the fixpoint block, needing no lemma of its own because
`partial_fixpoint` already handles a `match`. One shape, one lemma, and a
catching arm may recurse. -/

/-- Run a computation and answer its completion as a value: `.ok` for a
normal one, `.error c` for an abrupt one. Nothing is swallowed — the
caller decides, by an ordinary `match`, which completions it handles and
rethrows the rest with `throwCompletion`. The heap comes out either way,
because the state is inside the `Except`, so a caught throw keeps every
write the abrupt part made.

Opaque for the same reason `catchReturn` is: `partial_fixpoint` cannot
eliminate a recursive call written under `tryCatch`, but it can see
through this definition given the monotonicity lemma below, and the
`match` that follows is one it already handles. -/

/-! ### Running the stack under `simp`

A proof about a closed program reduces `((x.run).run h)`, and for that
`simp` has to push `ExceptT.run` through every bind and every state
operation. Core tags `StateT.run_bind` as `simp` but not
`ExceptT.run_bind`, so a proof adds that one lemma to its set by hand
(with `Except.map`, which the `Functor` arm of a `do` block leaves
behind); the three below supply what core has no lemma for at all,
namely `ExceptT.run` of the lifted state operations. They are stated with
`StateT.mk` on the right so that `StateT.run_mk` takes it from there. -/

    (get : EvalM Heap).run = StateT.mk (fun h => some (Except.ok h, h)) := rfl

  pure (.obj (← allocObj { proto := some arrayProtoRef, kind := .array n true }))

/-- Throw one of the evaluator's own runtime errors: a fresh object whose
prototype is the kind's, carrying the message as an own property. The
`name` it will report comes from that prototype, so the object is exactly
what `new TypeError(message)` builds, which is what makes the evaluator's
refusals catchable and testable with `instanceof`. It carries
`[[ErrorData]]` for the same reason, so `Object.prototype.toString` on
one answers `[object Error]`; `message` is non-enumerable, as 20.5.8.1
has it.

Every message the evaluator raises is in one table in `Tarski/Eval.lean`'s
header. test262 never inspects them; the table exists so the tests can
pin what the binary prints. -/

passed in so the message can say which binding it was. -/
