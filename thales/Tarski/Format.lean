/-! `Value → String` for the executable: what the binary prints for a
completion value, for a `print` argument, and for a thrown value that is not
an `Error` object.

The number arm is ECMA's `Number::toString`, which lives in the library
(`Js/Number/ToString.lean`) so that a run and a `Theorem` mean the same
thing by it. Nothing here formats a number itself.

The string arm is **lossy**: a string is UTF-16 code units, and an
unpaired surrogate has no UTF-8 spelling, so it prints as U+FFFD — which
is what Node writes to a UTF-8 stdout too, so the `exe` fixtures still
agree. -/

/-- A value, as the binary prints it. Every arm is reachable: a script
may `throw "x"`, `throw {}`, or `throw Symbol()`, and `describeThrown`
falls back to this for a thrown value that is not an Error object. The
symbol arm is SymbolDescriptiveString, which is what `String(sym)`
answers and the one place a symbol becomes text without a `TypeError`. -/
