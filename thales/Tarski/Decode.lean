import Lean.Data.Json
import Tarski.Ast

/-! Decoding `lemma/schemas/tarski-estree.schema.json` into the AST.

Strict in both directions: a node kind outside the slice is
`unsupported`, and a node kind inside it with the wrong shape is
`malformed`. The two are different outcomes because they mean different
things to a caller — the first says "tarski does not evaluate this
program yet", the second says "whatever produced this JSON is broken".

`Lean.Data.Json` is imported here and nowhere else in the evaluator, so
`Tarski.Eval`'s import footprint stays `Js` plus its own AST.

The monad carries one `Nat` of state, the next tagged-template site
number: a template object is cached per Parse Node, and this pass is the
one that sees the document in order. `decodeProgram` runs the state from
zero and answers an `Except`, so a caller never sees it.

Object literals arrive whole, spread included. A numeric key decodes as
a *computed* key over its `numLit`, so `{ 1.5: x }` takes its spelling
from ToPropertyKey at evaluation; an `async` or generator member is
`Property async` or `Property generator`.

Patterns arrive whole too, and `decodePattern` is one decoder for both
families: ESTree gives them one node family and the AST has one
`Pattern`. What the grammar refuses is `malformed` here — a
`RestElement` that is not last, a defaulted rest parameter, a compound
operator on a pattern, a pattern declarator with no initializer, and
`for await` — because the bridge emits none of them and a document that
does is a broken producer. An object rest whose argument is itself a
pattern is `unsupported`: it is real syntax (`({ ...[a] } = o)`) whose
early error this epic does not check.

Classes arrive whole. What a class may spell and the AST may not is
refused here by name: a numeric or computed key, an `async` or
generator member, an `accessor` field, and a decorator. `new.target`
never reaches this file — the bridge has no node for it, so it arrives
as a placeholder.

A string literal is decoded from its `raw` source text, not from its
`value`: `Lean.Json` replaces a lone surrogate with U+FFFD, so `"\uD800"`
would otherwise reach the evaluator as a string the source does not name.
The two are cross-checked wherever the literal is representable both
ways. A **legacy octal escape** is `unsupported` — a strict-mode early
error, refused by name rather than guessed at, and the second thing in
this file that says the word.

`Function(...)` and `new Function(...)` are refused here by name, as the
`$262` hooks are and for the same reason: the constructor's *semantics*
are `eval` by another spelling and outside the epic, while the intrinsic
itself must exist for `Function.prototype` to be reachable at all. An
alias — `const F = Function; F("x")` — escapes the refusal and meets a
`TypeError` instead, a documented limit of refusing syntactically. -/

`"\ud800"` as U+FFFD, silently, so `"\uD800"` would reach the evaluator

`raw` on every `Literal`, so nothing on the bridge's side has to change.
