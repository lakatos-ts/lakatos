import Tarski.Simp

/-! A `for`-`of` reduced under `simp`, one *iteration* at a time.

`evalForOf` recurses until an iterator says stop, which `simp` cannot
see, so it is never in `tarski_eval` and its equation is `rw`'s —
`Test/Tarski/ForUnfoldTest.lean`'s rule, not
`Test/Tarski/ForInUnfoldTest.lean`'s: there the `rw` count is the
prototype depth, here it is the **iteration count plus one**, the last
`rw` being the step that finds the iterator done.

Everything inside one iteration reduces without help, and that is what
this file is really pinning: `iteratorStep`, `bindForIn`, `bindPattern`,
`writeLeaf`, and — because `callIteratorNative` **is** in the set, unlike
`callReflectNative` and its two neighbours — `%ArrayIteratorPrototype%`'s
`next` all unfold in the set, so one step of the array iterator costs no
lemma list at all.

The heap is built by hand rather than run up from `Heap.initial`, for
`ForInUnfoldTest`'s reason: what this file is about is the shape of the
loop, and three objects show that as well as a realm does. -/
