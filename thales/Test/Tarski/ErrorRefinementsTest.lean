/-! The `Error` refinements: `cause`, `AggregateError`, `Error.isError`,
and the absence of `stack`.

`cause` lands in the one arm the seven constructors share, so it is one
InstallErrorCause for all of them; it is non-enumerable and defined after
`message`, which is what `Object.getOwnPropertyNames` reads back.

`AggregateError` is a native of its own rather than an eighth
`ErrorKind`: `ErrorKind` is the set the evaluator itself throws and the
set the emitter accepts by name, and its order fixes the realm's first
references and cells. Its `errors` is read as an **array-like** rather
than iterated — IterableToList is #394's — which is the one place this
differs from the specification, and it differs only for an argument that
has a `length` and no `@@iterator`.

`stack` is absent **by design**, not by omission: it is not in the
specification, and an evaluator with no call stack to report has nothing
honest to put there. The two guards at the end pin the absence. -/
