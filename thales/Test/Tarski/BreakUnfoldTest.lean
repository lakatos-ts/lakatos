/-! A labelled `break` out of nested loops, proved one iteration at a
time.

`Test/Tarski/WhileUnfoldTest.lean` is the same shape over one loop and a
normal exit; this one adds the part a catching arm could break. The
`break outer` is thrown from the inner loop's body, crosses two
`attempt`s — the inner `evalWhile`'s and the inner `evalLoop`'s, neither
of which answers for it — and is caught by `evalLabeled`'s frame for
`outer`. That all of it stays transparent to `simp` is what makes a
postcondition over a loop with a labelled exit provable at all, and the
`rw` count is still the iteration count: one outer, one inner. -/

-- `Test/Tarski/WhileUnfoldTest.lean`'s set plus what a label and a
-- caught completion add. `attempt` is in it and `evalWhile` is not: the
-- first is an ordinary definition whose unfolding terminates, the second
-- is the loop.
-- `applyCoercing_prim` and `toNumberValue_prim` (`Tarski/Simp.lean`) are
-- the two ground lemmas that close a coercion of a primitive in one
-- rewrite: ToPrimitive answers a `Value` now, so without them every
-- iteration's arithmetic pushes `simp` through a constructor match.
