import Tarski.Simp

/-! A postcondition proved through a `do`/`while`, one iteration at a
time — `Test/Tarski/WhileUnfoldTest.lean`'s twin.

`evalDoWhile` is `evalWhile`'s neighbour on the short list of definitions
whose equations never join a simp set: it recurses until a heap value
says stop, which `simp` cannot see, so it is unfolded with `rw`. Its
equation is a different one from `evalWhile`'s — the body comes first —
which is why the two are separate definitions rather than one with a
flag, and it is what makes the count below three rather than four: the
last unfolding is the one whose test fails, and the body has already run
that many times. -/
