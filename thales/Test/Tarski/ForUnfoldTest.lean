import Tarski.Simp

/-! A postcondition proved through a `for`, one iteration at a time.

`Test/Tarski/WhileUnfoldTest.lean` is the same shape over a `while`.
`evalFor` is the second definition whose equation never joins a simp set,
and for the same reason: added to one it would rewrite forever on a loop
whose exit simp cannot see, while `rw` exposes exactly one iteration. So
the `rw` count is the iteration count here too.

What this test pins beyond that is that the machinery around the loop
stays transparent to `simp`: the `var` pass (`varNames`, `hoistVars`)
that now runs ahead of every script, the per-iteration copy
(`copyBindings`, `Env.rebind`), the head's own scope, and the update
operator. If any of those became opaque, a `@ensures` proof over a
counted loop would stop reducing, and this is where that shows up. -/

-- `Test/Tarski/WhileUnfoldTest.lean`'s set plus what a `for` adds: the
-- `var` pass every script now runs, the head's scope and its copies, and
-- the update operator. `evalForLoop` is in it and `evalFor` is not —
-- the first runs once, the second is the loop.
-- `applyCoercing_prim` and `toNumberValue_prim` (`Tarski/Simp.lean`) are
-- the two ground lemmas that close a coercion of a primitive in one
-- rewrite: ToPrimitive answers a `Value` now, so without them every
-- iteration's arithmetic pushes `simp` through a constructor match.
