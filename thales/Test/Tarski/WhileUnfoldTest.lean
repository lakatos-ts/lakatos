/-! A postcondition proved through a `while`, one iteration at a time.

`evalWhile` is the one definition whose equation never joins a simp set.
Added to one, it would rewrite forever on a loop whose exit simp cannot
see; used with `rw`, it exposes exactly one iteration, and the proof is
the loop run symbolically: unfold, simplify, unfold, until the test is
false. The `rw` count is therefore the iteration count, and a loop whose
bound is not a literal needs an invariant instead — which is the shape
the epic's `@ensures` proofs will take. -/
