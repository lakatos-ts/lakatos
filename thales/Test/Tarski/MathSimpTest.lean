import Tarski.Simp

/-! A program that calls two `Math` members reduces to its result under
`simp`.

`ArraySimpTest` does this for an Array exotic object and a `NativeFn`;
this is the same shape over what #382 added, and it pins two things at
once. First, **a built-in whose body is a library definition is still
simp-transparent**: `mathUnary` and `toNumberValue` unfold, and the
library's `tsTrunc` and `tsSign` are ordinary definitions `decide` closes,
so each is one local lemma rather than an opaque wall. Second, **a
fifty-three-object `Heap.initial` is still a literal `simp` can push
`readObj` through** — the realm grew by twenty-four objects here, and
nothing needed a size lemma to stay computable.

No prototype step is taken at all: `trunc` and `sign` are own properties
of `Math` rather than inherited ones, and an own-property read is
`getFrom`'s own arm, which is in the set. `ObjectSimpTest` records what
a read that has to climb costs instead. -/
