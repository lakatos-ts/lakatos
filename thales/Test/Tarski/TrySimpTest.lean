import Tarski.Simp

/-! A `try`/`finally` whose finalizer overrides reduces to its result
under `simp`.

`Test/Tarski/CallSimpTest.lean` pins that a `return` stays transparent to
`simp` through `catchReturn`; this pins the same for a completion
`attempt` reified and a later step put back. Nothing here is a loop, so
there is no `rw`: the block's completion is caught, matched, and rethrown
inside the fixpoint, and `simp` runs all of it. That is what makes a
postcondition over a function with a `try` in it provable at all.

The program is the issue's own acceptance criterion, `finally` overriding
a `return`, proved rather than only guarded. -/
