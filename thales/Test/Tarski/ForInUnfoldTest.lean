/-! A `for`-`in` reduced under `simp`, one *object* at a time.

`Test/Tarski/ForUnfoldTest.lean` is the same shape over a `for`, where
the `rw` count is the iteration count. Here it is not, and that is the
whole point of this file: `for`-`in` recurses on two different things,
and only one of them is `rw`'s.

`evalForIn` walks a **key list**, which is data — the keys were taken
from the object when the object was reached — so `simp` reduces a whole
level without help, however many keys it has. `forInNext` is the step to
the next object on the prototype chain, a heap link like `getFromUp`'s,
and that is what is unfolded one step at a time. So the `rw` count is the
**prototype depth**: two here, one to reach the parent and one to find
that the parent has no prototype of its own, while the two keys cost
nothing.

The heap is built by hand rather than run up from `Heap.initial`.
Whole-program `simp` over the realm is exercised by
`Test/Tarski/ObjectSimpTest.lean` and its neighbours and is minutes of
wall time here, the realm being eighty-nine objects and
`Obj.ownKeys` reading every key of every level as a possible array index
(#471 is the ceiling that sets). What this file is about is the shape of
the enumeration, which two objects show as well as a realm does.
`Test/Tarski/ForInTest.lean` is where the behaviour is checked. -/

-- The evaluator's non-loop equations plus the enumeration's own. `evalForIn`
-- and `bindForIn` are in the set and `forInNext` is not: the first two run
-- out with the key list, the third is the chain.
-- `applyCoercing_prim` and `toNumberValue_prim` (`Tarski/Simp.lean`) are
-- the two ground lemmas that close a coercion of a primitive in one
-- rewrite: ToPrimitive answers a `Value` now, so without them every
-- iteration's arithmetic pushes `simp` through a constructor match.
