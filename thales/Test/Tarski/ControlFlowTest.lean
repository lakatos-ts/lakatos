/-! `break`, `continue`, and labels — where they go and what value they
carry.

Two things are pinned here, and the second is the easier one to get
wrong. Where a jump goes: an unlabelled `break` ends the innermost loop,
a labelled one ends the statement its label names — which may be a block,
not a loop at all — and a `continue` resumes the loop whose label set
holds its target. What a jump *completes with*: the completion record's
`[[Value]]`, which the spec fills by UpdateEmpty at every statement list
the completion crosses, so `while (true) { 2; break; }` is `2` and not
`undefined`. The evaluator threads a running value through `evalStmt`
instead of catching at every list; the cases below are that threading
measured against what `eval` answers in an engine.

A jump with nowhere to go is an early error in a real engine, and early
errors are outside this epic, so here it escapes as the abrupt completion
it is and the binary exits 1. -/
