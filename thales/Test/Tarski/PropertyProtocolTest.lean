/-! `delete` and `in`: `[[Delete]]` and `[[HasProperty]]`.

Both land with the descriptors rather than with the loops, because
neither can be written without them: `delete` refuses a
non-configurable key and `in` is the prototype walk `findProperty`
already performs for a write.

`delete` takes a *reference*, which is why it is an `Expr` of its own
rather than a `UnaryOp`: a bare identifier is the strict-mode early
error, reported here at the point of use as `super` and an out-of-scope
private name already are. -/
