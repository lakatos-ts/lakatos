import Tarski.Simp

/-! A closed, loop-free program reduces to its result under `simp`.

This is the shape every `@ensures` proof over the evaluator will take:
the recursive equations are theorems, so `simp` runs the program
symbolically until nothing is left but binary64 arithmetic, and the
arithmetic is closed by `decide` against the library's own definitions.
Nothing here is an unfolding of `evalWhile` — that one is `rw`'s, and
`Test/Tarski/WhileUnfoldTest.lean` is where it happens.

`decide` cannot do this job on its own: a `partial_fixpoint` definition
has equations, not a reduction behaviour, so the kernel does not compute
it. The `#eval` below is the other half — the compiled evaluator agrees
with the proved one. -/
