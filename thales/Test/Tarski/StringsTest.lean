/-! String primitives: concatenation, order, `length`, indexing, and
`String(value)`.

A string is a sequence of **UTF-16 code units** (`Js.JsString`), so
`length`, indexing, and the four relations are code-unit semantics and a
lone surrogate is a value like any other: a surrogate pair comes apart
into two one-unit strings and joins back under `+`. This file is the
primitive and its operators; `Test/Tarski/StringBuiltinsTest.lean` is
`String.prototype`'s surface and `Test/Tarski/StringWrapperTest.lean` is
the exotic object.

ToNumber of a string is the library's StringToNumber, so a mixed-type
relation like `"a" < 1` is a real comparison that answers `false` because
`"a"` is NaN, and `" 2 " * 3` is `6`. -/

private def outcome (p : Program) : String :=
  match runScript p with
  | none => "<diverges>"
  | some (.error (.throw v), h) => s!"uncaught: {describeThrown h v}"

  | some (.ok none, _) => "<empty>"

private def expr (e : Expr) : Program := [.exprStmt e]

/-! ## Concatenation

`+` is concatenation when *either* operand is a string, and the other
side is ToString'd — through the provisional formatter for a number. -/

-- `"a" + "b";`
#guard outcome (expr (.binary .add (.strLit "a") (.strLit "b"))) == "ab"

-- `"n=" + 3;`
#guard outcome (expr (.binary .add (.strLit "n=") (.numLit 3.0))) == "n=3"

-- `1 + "a";`
#guard outcome (expr (.binary .add (.numLit 1.0) (.strLit "a"))) == "1a"

-- `"" + true;`
#guard outcome (expr (.binary .add (.strLit "") (.boolLit true))) == "true"

-- `"x" + null;`
#guard outcome (expr (.binary .add (.strLit "x") .nullLit)) == "xnull"

-- `"x" + undefined;`
#guard outcome (expr (.binary .add (.strLit "x") .undefLit)) == "xundefined"

/-! ## Order

Two strings compare by **code unit** — IsLessThan step 3 — which is not
numeric order: `"10"` precedes `"9"`. One string and one number go numeric, through
StringToNumber. -/

-- `"a" < "b";`
#guard outcome (expr (.binary .lt (.strLit "a") (.strLit "b"))) == "true"

-- `"b" < "a";`
#guard outcome (expr (.binary .lt (.strLit "b") (.strLit "a"))) == "false"

-- `"a" < "ab";` — a prefix precedes what extends it.
#guard outcome (expr (.binary .lt (.strLit "a") (.strLit "ab"))) == "true"

-- `"" < "a";`
#guard outcome (expr (.binary .lt (.strLit "") (.strLit "a"))) == "true"

-- `"10" < "9";` — string order, not numeric.
#guard outcome (expr (.binary .lt (.strLit "10") (.strLit "9"))) == "true"

-- `"a" <= "a";`
#guard outcome (expr (.binary .le (.strLit "a") (.strLit "a"))) == "true"

-- `"b" > "a";`
#guard outcome (expr (.binary .gt (.strLit "b") (.strLit "a"))) == "true"

-- `"a" >= "b";`
#guard outcome (expr (.binary .ge (.strLit "a") (.strLit "b"))) == "false"

-- `"a" < 1;` — mixed operands go numeric, and `"a"` is NaN, so this is
-- false the way every comparison with a NaN is.
#guard outcome (expr (.binary .lt (.strLit "a") (.numLit 1.0))) == "false"

-- `"10" < 9;` — numeric, not string order: the opposite of `"10" < "9"`.
#guard outcome (expr (.binary .lt (.strLit "10") (.numLit 9.0))) == "false"

-- `"1" < 2;`
#guard outcome (expr (.binary .lt (.strLit "1") (.numLit 2.0))) == "true"

-- `"" < 1;` — the empty string is `+0`.
#guard outcome (expr (.binary .lt (.strLit "") (.numLit 1.0))) == "true"

-- `" 2 " * 3;` — white space at both ends is trimmed.
#guard outcome (expr (.binary .mul (.strLit " 2 ") (.numLit 3.0))) == "6"

-- `"0x10" - 0;` — the non-decimal forms of the literal grammar.
#guard outcome (expr (.binary .sub (.strLit "0x10") (.numLit 0.0))) == "16"

/-! ## `length` and indexing

A string's own properties are its `length` and its index keys, in code
units. A key that is not one of those is read through
`String.prototype` — without allocating a wrapper, the receiver staying
the primitive, exactly as a Number's is. -/

-- `"abc".length;`
#guard outcome (expr (.member (.strLit "abc") "length")) == "3"

-- `"".length;`
#guard outcome (expr (.member (.strLit "") "length")) == "0"

-- `"abc"[1];`
#guard outcome (expr (.index (.strLit "abc") (.numLit 1.0))) == "b"

-- `"abc"["1"];` — the same property under its string spelling.
#guard outcome (expr (.index (.strLit "abc") (.strLit "1"))) == "b"

-- `"abc"[3];`
#guard outcome (expr (.index (.strLit "abc") (.numLit 3.0))) == "undefined"

-- `"abc"["01"];` — not a canonical index, so an ordinary key.
#guard outcome (expr (.index (.strLit "abc") (.strLit "01"))) == "undefined"

-- `"abc".foo;`
#guard outcome (expr (.member (.strLit "abc") "foo")) == "undefined"

-- `"abc".length = 1;` — strict mode: a write to a primitive throws.
#guard outcome (expr (.assign (.member (.strLit "abc") "length") (.numLit 1.0)))
  == "uncaught: TypeError: Cannot set properties of abc (setting 'length')"

/-! ## `String(value)`

ToString and nothing more when it is *called*; `new String(v)` is the
wrapper object, which `Test/Tarski/StringWrapperTest.lean` covers. The
number arm is the library's `Number::toString`. -/

/-- `String(<arg>);` -/
private def stringOf (args : List Expr) : Program :=
  expr (.call (.ident "String") args)

#guard outcome (stringOf [.numLit 1.0]) == "1"
#guard outcome (stringOf [.numLit 2.5]) == "2.5"
#guard outcome (stringOf [.unary .neg (.numLit 0.0)]) == "0"
#guard outcome (stringOf [.binary .div (.numLit 0.0) (.numLit 0.0)]) == "NaN"
#guard outcome (stringOf [.boolLit true]) == "true"
#guard outcome (stringOf [.nullLit]) == "null"
#guard outcome (stringOf [.undefLit]) == "undefined"
#guard outcome (stringOf []) == ""
#guard outcome (stringOf [.strLit "x"]) == "x"
#guard outcome (stringOf [.binary .div (.numLit 1.0) (.numLit 3.0)]) == "0.3333333333333333"

-- `typeof String(1);`
#guard outcome (expr (.unary .typeof (.call (.ident "String") [.numLit 1.0]))) == "string"

-- `const o = { toString: function () { return "t"; } }; String(o);` —
-- the string hint tries `toString` first. Method shorthand is #395's, so
-- the member is a function expression.
#guard outcome
    [ .varDecl .«const» [{ target := "o", init := some (.objectLit
        [.init "toString" (.funcExpr none [] [.returnStmt (some (.strLit "t"))])]) }],
      .exprStmt (.call (.ident "String") [.ident "o"]) ]
  == "t"

-- `String({});` — `Object.prototype.toString` is what the string hint
-- reaches first.
#guard outcome (stringOf [.objectLit []]) == "[object Object]"

-- `new String("x");` — the wrapper object, so `typeof` is `object`.
#guard outcome (expr (.unary .typeof (.new (.ident "String") [.strLit "x"]))) == "object"

-- `typeof String;`
#guard outcome (expr (.unary .typeof (.ident "String"))) == "function"

/-! ## UTF-16

A surrogate pair is two code units, each a string of its own, and
concatenating them gives the pair back. This is what a Lean `String`
could not hold. -/

private def astral : String := String.singleton (Char.ofNat 0x10000)

-- `"😀".length;`
#guard outcome (expr (.member (.strLit "😀") "length")) == "2"

-- `"😀"[0] + "😀"[1] === "😀";`
#guard outcome
    (expr (.binary .strictEq
      (.binary .add (.index (.strLit "😀") (.numLit 0.0)) (.index (.strLit "😀") (.numLit 1.0)))
      (.strLit "😀")))
  == "true"

-- `"\uD83D" + "\uDE00" === "😀";` — the two halves as literals.
#guard outcome
    (expr (.binary .strictEq
      (.binary .add (.strLit ⟨[0xD83D]⟩) (.strLit ⟨[0xDE00]⟩)) (.strLit "😀")))
  == "true"

-- The order is code units, not code points: an astral character is a
-- high surrogate first, so it precedes U+FFFF. Lean's `String` order
-- says the opposite, and that was the defect #391 owns.
#guard outcome (expr (.binary .lt (.strLit astral) (.strLit "\uFFFF"))) == "true"

-- A lone surrogate prints as U+FFFD, which is what a UTF-8 stdout can
-- write; the value itself is the code unit.
#guard outcome (expr (.member (.strLit ⟨[0xD800]⟩) "length")) == "1"
#guard outcome (expr (.strLit ⟨[0xD800]⟩)) == "\uFFFD"
