/-! `var`: function-scoped, hoisted, and initialized to `undefined`.

`var` is `let`'s opposite on every axis this evaluator models. Its scope
is the enclosing function or script rather than the block it was written
in, so it escapes a block and does not escape a function. Its cell is
created and filled with `undefined` at instantiation rather than at its
declarator, so reading one early answers `undefined` where a `let` would
throw. It may be declared twice, and a bare re-declaration writes
nothing. And it never erases a binding that was already there — a
parameter of the same name, or a global — because instantiation skips a
name that already has a cell. -/
