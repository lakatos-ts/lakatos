# The evaluator's arithmetic boundary.
#
# Every arithmetic and comparison the evaluator performs must be one the
# `Js` library models, so that a `Theorem` and a run appeal to the same
# meaning. Lean's own `Float` instances *are* the library's model of
# `Number` — `JsNumber := Float` — so infix `+ - * /`, unary `-`, `==`,
# `<`, and `≤` are the sanctioned spellings and stay allowed. What is
# banned under `Tarski/` is everything else that reaches binary64
# directly: any `Float`-namespace call (`Float.sqrt`, `Float.lt`,
# `Float.ofNat`, …) and the method-syntax operations and coercions
# (`.isNaN`, `.toUInt64`, `.floor`, `.toString`, …). Anything the library
# names — `Js.Number.FloatOps.tsRem`, `Js.floatNaN`, `Js.JsVal.typeof` —
# is a `Js.` name and never matches.
#
# The evaluator performs exactly one conversion of its own, and it is not
# a `Float` operation: `Nat.toFloat` (that is, `Float.ofNat`) turning a
# length or an index into a Number, spelled once in `Value.ofNat`. It is
# exact below 2^53, has no `extern`, and so reduces in the kernel. The
# conversion in the other direction is the library's — ToIntegerOrInfinity,
# `Js.Number.FloatOps.integerOrInfinity?`, which `uint32Of?` and `radix?`
# both go through — so `Tarski/` spells no Number-to-integer conversion of
# its own at all. Neither spelling matches the pattern below, and neither
# is allow-listed: they are named here so that a third one has to be
# argued for.
#
# The boundary is about arithmetic the evaluator *performs*, so each file
# is stripped of its comments and its string-literal text before the
# pattern runs: `Error.prototype.toString` is a JavaScript method this
# file has opinions about only when Lean calls it, and the same will hold
# of `Math.round` (#382) and `Number.prototype.toString` (#388). An
# interpolated term inside `s!"…{e}…"` is code and is kept. Line numbers
# survive the stripping, so a hit still names its line.
#
# There are no exemptions. The optional directory argument (default
# `Tarski`) lets CI point the check at `scripts/boundary-fixture`, which
# plants a violation, and so check that the check bites.
#
# Usage: sh scripts/check-boundary.sh [directory]
