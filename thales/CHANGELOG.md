# Changelog

All notable changes to Thales are recorded here. The README and the
`docs/` tree are the source of documentation; this file only tracks
release-to-release deltas. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog 1.1.0](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## Unreleased

After 0.7, the next headline candidate is **provably-safe array
indexing**, re-deferred from 0.7 (see ADR-0002). Two contexts:
literal-index into a literal/known-length array (`[10, 20, 30][1]`) and
length-narrowed access with a `Natural` index (`if (i < xs.length) xs[i]`
where `i: Natural`), both returning `T` instead of `T | undefined`. Tuple
indexing (`tup[k]`) joins the same static-length family. The Lean-side
soundness basis is a seventh boundary axiom (`Float.toUInt64_of_isNatural`)
plus `Natural.toNat`, which round-trip an `isNatural` Float through
`UInt64.toNat` for use as a `Nat`-typed index. forEach/map/filter/reduce
callback indexing (P3) is a later stretch. Sequencing against Arc-1 work
(loops / local mutation, see `docs/future.md`) is not yet fixed.

## 0.7 — forthcoming

A **0.6-completeness** release: it finishes features already inside the
subset and adds no new language surface. Provably-safe array indexing —
the prior 0.7 plan — was re-sequenced out; see ADR-0002 for why.

### Added

- `Array<T>.map` / `Array<T>.reduce` return-type inference for inline
  arrow / function-expression callbacks: `[1, 2, 3].map(x => x * 2)` is
  typed `number[]` (was `Array<any>`), and `reduce`'s accumulator and
  result take the type of the seed value. Monomorphic only —
  named-reference and generic callbacks stay conservative. `filter` was
  already exact.
- TH0081 at two further positions: object-literal property values and
  array-literal elements. 0.6 fired it only at variable declarations,
  function parameters, and return statements. (Default parameter values
  and explicit generic type arguments are deferred — both require
  parser/AST changes to capture syntax the parser currently discards;
  spread arguments additionally need spread-into-call semantics; the
  class-property context is unreachable while classes are TH0030.)
- Top-level `if`-statements. 0.6 lowered only top-level declarations and
  bare expressions, forcing top-level `if`s into a function wrapper; they
  now lower into the script's `#eval (do …)` sequence, reusing the
  existing `is<T>` narrowing emit. Conjunction guards
  (`if (isInteger(x) && isByte(x))`) narrow to the most-specific
  refinement kind.
- Template-literal emission. `` `a=${x}` `` now lowers to string
  concatenation with per-interpolation `JSShow` (previously emitted as an
  unsupported-expression placeholder). Template literals were already
  parsed and type-checked; this completes their emit path. No new
  language surface.

## 0.6.1 — 2026-05-24

Internal refactor with no user-visible change to diagnostics, emit
output, or runtime behavior.

### Changed

- Split `Thales/TypeCheck/Generic.lean` (832 → 608 lines): pure
  structural substitution moves to `TypeSubstitution.lean`; the
  `checkAssignable` gate moves to `Assignability.lean`. The
  irreducible mutual block (`resolveTypeGeneric`, `isSubtype`,
  `evaluateConditionalType`, `evaluateSingleConditional`,
  `evaluateMappedType`) stays intact.
- Consolidate TH0080 / TH0081 emission behind a single classifier in
  the new `RefinementDiag.lean`; the two call sites in
  `checkAssignable` and `emitArgMismatch` stop duplicating the logic.
- Delete the empty `Thales/TypeCheck/Subtype.lean` (17 lines, all
  comment) left over from an earlier reorganization.
- Promote `exprLoc` to `Thales.AST` (exhaustive over every
  `Expression` constructor); `tsExprLoc` moves to `Thales.TypeCheck`
  and delegates to it. Three private copies — two identical 7-case
  partials in `Check.lean` and `Synth.lean`, and an unused 28-case
  version in `SubsetCheck.lean` — are removed.

## 0.6 — 2026-05-24

### Added

- `@thales/prelude` module exporting four built-in bounded number
  types: `Integer` (safe integer), `Natural` (non-negative safe
  integer), `Byte` (`0..255`), and `Bit` (`0` or `1`). The chain
  `Bit ⊆ Byte ⊆ Natural ⊆ Integer ⊆ number` is enforced at compile
  time.
- Eight prelude functions per refinement type:
  `isInteger`/`isNatural`/`isByte`/`isBit` (TypeScript type-guard
  predicates) and `asInteger`/`asNatural`/`asByte`/`asBit` (throwing
  constructors that raise `RangeError` on out-of-range input). At the
  top level, a bare `asBit(2);` statement is emitted as an
  `asBitEffect` IO mirror that `IO.Process.exit 1`s on failure so the
  Lean path matches `tsx`'s nonzero exit.
- Predicate-guard narrowing: `if (isInteger(x)) { ... }` (also
  `Number.isSafeInteger`) narrows `x` to the corresponding refinement
  type in the true branch. `Number.isInteger` is intentionally not
  recognized — it admits unsafe integers.
- TH0080: numeric literal out of range for a refinement type (e.g.,
  `const c: Byte = 256`).
- TH0081: a `number`-typed value is not assignable to a refinement slot
  without narrowing or constructor evidence (variable declarations,
  function parameters, return statements).
- TH9004: emitted Lean code contains `sorry`. The conformance harness
  greps every emitted file after emit and fails on a hit.
- Lean-side reflection for `Integer`: `Integer.toInt` and
  `Integer.ofInt` round-trip the type into `Int`, with arithmetic
  homomorphisms for `+`/`-`/`*`. Downstream Lean proofs can reason
  about safe-integer arithmetic at the `Int` level.
- Twelve IEEE-754 boundary axioms in `Thales.TS.Runtime`, grouped by
  purpose (Float ↔ Int boundary, `Float.abs`, `Integer` reflection).
  See [`docs/axioms.md`](docs/axioms.md) for the full list and
  rationale. `JSShow` instances for the four refinement types so
  `console.log(x)` prints them the same way as the VM path.
- [`docs/beyond-typescript.md`](docs/beyond-typescript.md): an
  orientation for readers who want to know what Thales gives you that
  TypeScript alone cannot — the bounded number types are the v0.6
  headline.

### Changed

- `Math.abs` is typed `Integer → Natural` when the argument is
  `Integer`-typed (still `number → number` otherwise). The Lean
  runtime ships `Math.absI : Integer → Natural` for this overload.
- `Array<T>.length` and `string.length` are typed `Natural` (was
  `number`). Existing code that assigned them to `number` continues to
  work via the chain's coercions.
- `Array<T>` callback types for `forEach`, `map`, `filter`, and
  `reduce` give the `index` parameter type `Natural` (was `number`).
- Conformance corpus relocated from `examples/` to
  `tests/conformance/{accept,reject,throws,future}`. Contributors
  adding fixtures should pick the directory that matches the fixture's
  expected outcome; `future/` holds parked fixtures the harness
  ignores.

### Fixed

- Conformance harness now passes `NODE_OPTIONS=--disable-warning=DEP0205`
  to its `tsx` invocation. tsx triggers Node's deprecated
  `module.register()` API once per process; the resulting stderr line
  was failing byte-identity checks on every fixture.

## 0.5 — 2026-04-28

Initial release.
