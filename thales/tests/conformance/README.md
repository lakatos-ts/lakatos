# Verdict-fixture corpus

End-to-end fixtures for `lakatos prove`. Each `.ts` file is one fixture, and
its bucket is its entire test specification: every `@ensures` annotation in
the file must receive the bucket's SZS status. There are no sidecar files
and no inline expectation directives.

A fixture that needs more than one module is a directory inside a bucket
whose `main.ts` is the entry: the harness runs `main.ts` alone and the rest
of the directory is the closure it imports (relative specifiers only, `.js`
as nodeNext writes them). Only the entry's annotations are graded, and the
bucket's status applies to them; the dependencies are never run as entries,
so annotations in them would go unchecked and do not belong there.

The harness is the root `tests/verdict-corpus.test.ts`, gated on
`LAKATOS_PROVE_E2E=1` like the prove e2e (it needs the Lean toolchain and is
minutes-slow). It copies the corpus into a scratch project, runs
`lakatos prove` once over every fixture, and diffs each annotation's status
against its bucket. Only the SZS status is bucket-checked; reason text is
the business of the e2e and unit suites.

Every fixture must type check: the corpus carries its own `tsconfig.json`,
lakatos forces its required strict options on top, and the harness copies
the config into the scratch project so the gate runs there exactly as it
does for a user. Check the corpus standalone with

    npx tsc -p engines/thales/tests/conformance --noEmit --strict

A program tsc refuses is not a fixture: the gate answers for it, so it has
no bucket here.

## Buckets

- `theorem/` — every annotation proves (`Theorem`). A residual site in a
  branch the property never takes does not stop a proof: the model reaches
  the site only on paths the domain or a guard rules out.
- `countersatisfiable/` — a false bounded claim: decide establishes falsity
  and the prover extracts a concrete witness (`CounterSatisfiable`).
- `gaveup/` — the proof ladder exhausts (`GaveUp`): an unbounded claim, for
  which there is no finite domain to evaluate and no arithmetic theory to
  reason with, so falsity on an unbounded domain has no counterexample to
  ship either. Also a bounded claim shown false whose witness the prover
  could not read back, which ships the falsity without the illustration.
- `nottried/` — the pipeline degrades the property (`NotTried`): it has
  no structured reading (a half-bounded range the DSL has no binder shape
  for, a connective the reading has no text for: `↔`, or a `→` nested
  under another connective), or a range endpoint exceeds the safe integer
  range.
- `inappropriate/` — the annotation is outside the model (`Inappropriate`),
  by either of two routes. The frontend classifies it when the
  declaration's signature or one of its statements uses a construct the
  pipeline cannot map, when a class fault carries no construct, or when the
  property itself mentions such a declaration or a refused operator. The
  prover reports it when the property's path reaches an unmodelable
  _expression_ — an unlisted standard-library member (a call like
  `Math.log`, a read like `Number.length`, a whitelisted call member read
  as a value), an operator the model does not cover (`&`, `??`, ...) or
  refuses on the merits (`**`), a call to a declaration outside the model,
  or a condition with no boolean reading — which the artifact carries as a
  residual site the prover cannot see through, and the reason names the
  site's construct.
- `timeout/` — every annotation must report `Timeout` under the reduced
  heartbeat budget the harness sets via `LAKATOS_PROVE_HEARTBEATS`; the
  bucket runs as its own prove invocation so the rest of the corpus keeps
  the default budget.

There is no `error/` bucket. `Error` is reserved for the engine failing —
a Lean run that dies before reporting, or the emitter's own invariants
breaking — and neither is a fixture.

Buckets are named after SZS statuses, lowercase. Buckets for statuses the
prover cannot yet reach arrive with the issues that add those capabilities,
so a capability upgrade shows up in the diff as a `git mv` between buckets
(the refuting prover moved false-claim fixtures from `gaveup/` to
`countersatisfiable/` exactly this way).

## Adding a fixture

Author a `.ts` file with at least one `@ensures` annotation, run the harness
locally, and place the file by its observed-and-intended verdict:

    LAKATOS_PROVE_E2E=1 npx vitest run tests/verdict-corpus.test.ts

A surprising verdict at authoring time is a finding to resolve, not an
expectation to adjust silently. If a file's annotations would earn different
verdicts, split it into one file per bucket.
