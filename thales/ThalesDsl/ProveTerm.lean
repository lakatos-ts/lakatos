/-! `#thales_prove` with a plain-`Prop` payload: the form the plain-Lean
emission pipeline writes (#144). The obligation is an ordinary term a
person can read and edit in the artifact; the elaboration recovers binder
structure from the payload's `ballIco` and `∀` heads so the same four-rung
ladder runs unchanged. The bare form — no payload at all — reports the
stub verdict. -/
