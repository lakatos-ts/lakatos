        // changed the denominator; emission.ts still carries two defensive
        // branches no input can reach. Reseeded 2026-08-29: the shared
        // parse gate refuses every unreadable formula before any spine
        // runs, so the enumeration's own rethrow and the emitter's bare
        // fallthrough joined that unreachable set. Reseeded 2026-08-31:
        // the pre-scan now threads each declarator's binding through the
        // rest of its list, so a local shadowing a builtin refuses at the
        // scan; nothing survives it to the typed walk's terminal throw,
        // which stays as the engine-bug signal it is. Reseeded
        // 2026-09-01: the stub now refuses a clamp-emptied domain per
        // annotation, so the last input that reached the enumeration's
        // positioned rethrow no longer does, and the arm is unreachable
        // behind the gate. Reseeded 2026-09-03: zero-argument discovery
        // lost its src/ fallback, whose branches were all covered, so the
        // denominator shrank while the unreachable set did not. Reseeded
        // 2026-09-09: the refused-operator scan was deleted, every operator
        // outside the model now refusing at the construct scan, so the
        // denominator shrank again while the unreachable set did not.
        // Ratcheted 2026-09-11: a body's expression refusals became residual
        // sites, leaving the construct and failed-member scans answering for
        // a property's own text alone — the arms only a body could reach were
        // deleted, and the ones a property cannot yet reach (a union place in
        // an atom) carry their own ignores. Ratcheted 2026-09-13: the tarski
        // parser bridge and its command joined the denominator fully covered.
        // Ratcheted 2026-09-13: the bridge grew the function, object, and
        // member nodes, every arm of them reached by a test — a function
        // without a body or a name is an ambient or module form a script
        // cannot contain, and those two carry their own ignores. Ratcheted
        // again 2026-09-13: the bridge's `throw`, `try`, label, and jump
        // nodes joined it fully covered, so the denominator grew while the
        // unreachable set did not. Ratcheted once more 2026-09-13: the
        // bridge's array literal, with its hole and spread arms, joined it
        // fully covered. Ratcheted 2026-09-14: the test262 runner joined it
        // fully covered — the fallbacks `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` asks for
        // on groups of patterns that always match, and the `setup` path that
        // would fetch tc39/test262 over the network, carry their own
        // ignores. Ratcheted again 2026-09-14: the whole-suite mode joined
        // it fully covered too — the budget arm, the roll-up, the summary,
        // and the two renderers, each reached by a test, and each writer
        // now asked for on its own as well as in the pair the scheduled
        // script asks for.
        // Ratcheted 2026-09-14: the bridge grew the `for`, `switch`, and
        // empty statements and the update operators, and the runner grew
        // `--slice-file`, every arm of all of them reached by a test.
        // Ratcheted again 2026-09-14: the bridge grew the class nodes —
        // the member kinds, the two key forms, `super`, a private name,
        // and every TypeScript-only form each refuses in place — with an
        // arm reached by a test for all of them. The one ignore added
        // with them is a dot access's name, which tsc types as an
        // identifier or a private name and nothing else.
        // Ratcheted 2026-09-14: `lakatos exe` joined it — `src/exe.ts` and
        // `tarski/frontend/src/binary.ts`, both fully covered, including
        // the arms a spawn that never started reaches (both streams null
        // beside an error).
        // Ratcheted again 2026-09-14: the bridge grew the template nodes
        // and every object-literal member — a shorthand, a computed key,
        // a numeric key, a method, a getter, a setter — with a test for
        // each arm, including the three a member is still refused under:
        // a `CoverInitializedName`, a BigInt key, and a TypeScript
        // modifier. The one ignore added with them is a template piece's
        // raw text, which the parser always sets.
        // Ratcheted 2026-09-15: the model channel joined `run.ts` fully
        // covered — both sentinels' parse and validation arms, the
        // correspondence budget's forwarding rule, and the per-artifact
        // timeout allowance, each reached by a test.
        // Ratcheted 2026-09-15: the bridge grew the pattern nodes — both
        // binding patterns, both assignment patterns, `RestElement`,
        // `SpreadElement`, and `ForOfStatement` — with a test for every
        // arm, including the three an assignment pattern is still refused
        // under (a BigInt key, a method, and an element that is not a
        // reference). No ignore was added with them: `objectMember`'s old
        // fallthrough became unreachable once spread got an arm of its
        // own, so the three accessor forms are the function's tail rather
        // than a guarded arm, and `declarators` no longer answers `null`.
        // Reseeded 2026-09-23: the shared runtime moved into core/ and the
        // two verdict joins into their engines, so the denominator is the
        // same code under new paths; the schema helper in core/tests/helpers
        // and the layering test joined it fully covered.
        //
        // Measure this from a path with no dot-directory in it. The include
        // globs above do not match through one, and a run from, say, a
        // worktree under .claude/ silently reports every loaded file instead
        // — different denominator, different numbers.
