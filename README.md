# Lakatos

Proofs and refutations for TypeScript.

You state a property of a function in a JSDoc annotation. Lakatos tries to
**refute** it — thousands of generated inputs hunting for a counterexample —
and then tries to **prove** it, for all inputs, with a theorem prover. You
get the strongest verdict your property has earned:

```
$ lakatos check src/foo.ts
foo # nonzero      REFUTED    counterexample: x = -1n, y = 0
bar # involutive   PROVED
baz # monotone     TESTED     10,000 runs, no counterexample; not proved
```

The name is from Imre Lakatos's _Proofs and Refutations_: mathematics
advances by conjectures, attempted proofs, and counterexamples that force
the conjecture to be repaired. That loop is exactly what this tool runs.

## Status

Both engines work end to end. `lakatos refute` scrapes `@ensures`
annotations, generates fast-check property tests, runs them, and prints a
per-annotation JSON report. `lakatos prove` emits a `.lean`
artifact per file under the run directory, runs it through the Lean engine
(`lake env lean`), and assembles the same per-annotation envelope from the
prover's verdicts; it requires the Lean toolchain (elan/lake) on PATH and,
for now, a lakatos checkout — the npm package does not yet ship the Lean
engine. `lakatos exe <file.ts>` strips one file's types with tsc, runs it
on the tarski evaluator — the same Lean semantics the proofs are stated
over — forwards `console.log` to stdout, and reports an uncaught throw as
`Uncaught <class>: <message>` on stderr with exit 1; it accepts exactly
the programs `prove` accepts and needs the same Lean toolchain and
checkout. `lakatos check` is a stub: it scrapes the same annotations,
reports each one `NotTried`, and exits 1. The rest of this README
describes the committed design.

Every invocation writes its artifacts into its own directory under
`.lakatos/`, named for the run's start time in UTC — the same instant the
report carries as `startedAt`. Nothing is ever overwritten and nothing is
ever pruned: add `.lakatos/` to your `.gitignore` and delete it when you
want the space back.

## Usage

```
$ lakatos refute src/foo.ts
lakatos: generated 1 property across 1 file(s) into .lakatos/2026-08-17T12-53-06.896Z/pabst/
{
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "startedAt": "2026-08-17T12:53:06.896Z",
  "cwd": "/path/to/project",
  "seed": 4226542574,
  "generated": 1,
  "passed": 0,
  "failed": 1,
  "annotations": [
    {
      "file": "src/foo.ts",
      "function": "isZero",
      "property": "wrong",
      "szs": "CounterSatisfiable",
      "kind": "falsified",
      "counterexample": {
        "x": 1
      }
    }
  ]
}
$ echo $?
1
```

The report (schema: `core/schemas/envelope.schema.json`) lists every scraped
annotation with an [SZS ontology](https://tptp.org/UserDocs/SZSOntology/)
status:

| Outcome                                                            | SZS status           |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------- |
| proved for all inputs, or every tuple of a finite domain evaluated | `Theorem`            |
| falsified (counterexample)                                         | `CounterSatisfiable` |

| engine ran out of budget (prover attempt, refuter walk)            | `Timeout`            |
| annotation depends on unmappable code                              | `Inappropriate`      |

| malformed annotation input                                         | `InputError`         |
| run interrupted before evaluating it                               | `User`               |

`refute` walks a domain of at most 1,000 tuples in full instead of sampling
it, so a clean pass over such a domain is a `Theorem` with
`kind: "enumerated"` and `cases`, the number of tuples evaluated; a walk
that outruns its wall-clock budget is a `Timeout` with `kind: "budget"`.
Larger domains are sampled, 1,000 runs per property, and the two sampled
`GaveUp` cases are distinguished by the `kind` field: present
(`"exhausted"`) when generation gave up, absent when every run passed.

A prover's `Theorem` also carries `model`, what the prover established
about the model the property was proved over:
`{ "status": "validated" }` when the model was proved equal to the
evaluator's run of the declaration's own syntax tree, and
`{ "status": "unvalidated", "reason": "…" }` when it was not — a
construct the model has no run for, a proof that did not go through, an
exhausted budget, or a declaration no obligation was stated for. The
prover's `GaveUp`, `Timeout`, `CounterSatisfiable`, and `Inappropriate`
carry it too where the prover reached them; a refuter entry never does.

`NotTried` also covers unhealthy runs: when the underlying engine run
fails outright — the test runner dies before reporting, a generated test
can't even load, the Lean toolchain is missing, the Lean run fails, or
its verdict lines are malformed — no property was actually evaluated, so
the run reports every scraped annotation `NotTried`, keeps the
diagnostics on stderr, and exits 2. Stdout is one parseable envelope in
every mode.

`User` covers interrupted runs: Ctrl-C at the terminal, a supervisor's
SIGTERM, a CI cancel. The run stops, every annotation it had not
finished evaluating reports `User` with the signal in its `reason`,
annotations already resolved keep the status they earned, and the run
exits 2. This holds for a signal that arrives while an engine is running
— the vitest of a refute, the lake or Lean of a prove — which is where a
run spends nearly all of its time. Outside that window, and for SIGKILL
anywhere, lakatos dies as any process does and prints nothing: not a
contract lakatos can keep, so it does not claim to.

`InputError` marks an annotation whose input is malformed at extraction
— a duplicate property name (all claimants of the ambiguous identity
collapse into one entry), or an `@ensures` on an inaccessible subject
such as a non-exported class or a non-public member. Sound annotations
in the same run still get real verdicts; the entry's `error` field
carries the diagnostic, and the run exits 2. Subjects without a proper
name still get entries under best-effort labels (`<anonymous>#m`,
`Box#<computed>`), with the diagnostic saying what is unsupported.

Commands: `lakatos refute`, `lakatos prove`, and `lakatos exe` (work
today), `lakatos check` (stub). All but `exe` take
`[files-or-globs...]`; with no files,
sources are the files `tsconfig.json` would compile. Every run type checks
the whole project first, under the project's own `tsconfig.json` with
lakatos's required strict options forced on top; a program that does not
compile is refused (every annotation reports `InputError`, exit 2). A run
without a `tsconfig.json` is refused the same way, as is any named file the
tsconfig's program leaves out: lakatos never analyzes code tsc has not
accepted. `--seed <n>` applies to refute only: passing a report's `seed`
back reproduces its run. `exe` takes exactly one file and runs it: no
program arguments, no module graph, no report.

Exit codes: `0` — clean run; `1` — counterexamples found, or a stubbed
command; `2` — usage or user error, or an engine failure, including an unhealthy or
interrupted run. For `exe` they read as a runtime's: `0` the program ran,
`1` it ended in an uncaught throw, `2` it was refused — by the typecheck
gate, by the evaluator naming a syntax node it does not know, or because
the Lean toolchain is not here.

## Layout

Everything is one repository, an npm workspace:

- `src/` — the lakatos CLI frontend (the npm package at the repo root).
- [`core/`](core/) — `@lakatos-ts/core`: what every tool shares at
  runtime — the result envelope and its JSON Schema, the SZS status
  vocabulary, interrupt handling, and run-directory claiming.
- [`engines/thales/`](engines/thales/) — the proof engine: an emitter
  that renders annotated TypeScript as plain Lean 4, with a graded
  automatic discharge ladder (exhaustive checking on bounded domains,
  then symbolic tactics, then an honest "unable to prove").
- [`engines/pabst/`](engines/pabst/) — the refutation engine: compiles
  properties to [fast-check](https://fast-check.dev/) runs.
- [`tarski/`](tarski/) — the JS semantics: the Lean library the proof
  engine proves against (`number` as binary64, the operations Lean lacks,
  the value domain, and their kernel-checked theory) and, over the same
  definitions, an evaluator for a growing fragment of JavaScript, with a
  TypeScript parser bridge whose ESTree JSON is the seam between the two.
- [`spec/`](lemma/spec/) — the Lemma annotation language: grammar, prose
  semantics, and conformance fixtures.

## Architecture

Lakatos is a thin frontend over two engines, one per side of the dialectic:

```
                 lakatos  (CLI, npm)
                /        \
        refute /          \ prove
              v            v
        engines/pabst   engines/thales
        (TypeScript;    (Lean 4; today: elan/lake
         fast-check)     on PATH — see Status)
```

The engines never depend on each other. The committed design is that
neither requires you to install Lean: the Lean engine will ship as a
prebuilt per-platform bundle that lakatos fetches once, Playwright-style,
built from this repository's own releases — frontend and engine cut from
the same commit, so there is no engine version to pin and no skew to
manage. Today that bundle does not exist yet: `lakatos prove` needs the
Lean toolchain (elan/lake) on PATH and a lakatos checkout, per Status
above.

Properties are written in [Lemma](lemma/spec/), a little specification language
embedded in JSDoc — annotated files remain ordinary TypeScript accepted by
`tsc --strict`.

What a `PROVED` verdict rests on — per declaration, the envelope's
`model` field says whether the prover's model was proved equal to the
evaluator's run of it, and why not — and the limits that remain are
stated in the spec's
[What a Theorem rests on](lemma/spec/semantics.md#what-a-theorem-rests-on).

## Commands

- **`lakatos check <file>`** — the flagship: refute first (fast — catches
  false properties in seconds), then prove, then report one graded verdict
  per property.
- `lakatos prove <file>` — proof engine only.
- `lakatos refute <file>` — refutation engine only. Note the semantics:
  the command names the _attempt_; finding no counterexample is success
  (exit 0), like any test run.
- `lakatos exe <file>` — run one file on the evaluator the proofs share
  their primitives with, so you can watch a program the prover reasons
  about actually run. Two limits are worth stating in place, and both are
  the ones
  [What a Theorem rests on](lemma/spec/semantics.md#what-a-theorem-rests-on)
  spells out: a proof's model is checked against the evaluator one
  declaration at a time, and where that check did not go through only the
  _primitives_ are shared (the envelope's `model` field says which);
  and `refute` runs on Node, not on this evaluator, so `exe` and `refute`
  can disagree exactly where the model and V8 do. The evaluator's own
  output formatting is its own third limit: `console.log` prints ToString
  of each argument, so an object is `[object Object]` rather than Node's
  inspection and `-0` prints as `0`.

## Verdicts

This section is the committed design for `lakatos check`, which is still
a stub; today the JSON report shown under Usage is the only output.
Human-readable verdicts lead; each carries an
[SZS ontology](https://tptp.org/UserDocs/SZSOntology/) status as
metadata, shared with both engines' own output:

| Verdict            | SZS status           | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------ | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| PROVED             | `Theorem`            | Holds for all inputs. Any assumptions (opaque callees, assumed contracts) are listed with the verdict, and the model's status is appended when it is not validated: `PROVED (model unvalidated: '**' is not supported)`. |
| REFUTED            | `CounterSatisfiable` | A concrete counterexample was found and is reported.                                                                                                                                                                     |
| TESTED, not proved | `Unknown`            | The refuter found nothing in its sampled runs and the prover gave up; per-engine sub-statuses (`GaveUp`, `Timeout`) say why.                                                                                             |

Exit codes are deliberately boring: `0` — no property refuted; `1` — at
least one property refuted (or a counterexample found by the prover);
`2` — input or usage error. "Tested but not proved" exits `0` with a
diagnostic: an unproved truth is not a failure.
